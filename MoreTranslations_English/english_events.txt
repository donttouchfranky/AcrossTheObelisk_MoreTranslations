e_aquar11_a_nm=Jack, the boat seller
e_aquar11_a_dsc=On the south pier, you find a boat sales stand. When you approach, a crocoman appears behind the counter and says:<br><br>"Hello travelers, if you want a boat to navigate the marsh, this is the best store in the area. I am Jack, a seller affiliated with the global merchants association, and I always offer the best prices, whatever some may say.<br><br>The price of a boat is 800g."
e_aquar11_a_dsca=Do you want to buy a boat?
e_aquar11_a_rp0=You don't want to buy anything.
e_aquar11_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to Jack and go on your way.
e_aquar11_a_rp1=You pay the 800g to buy a boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp1_s=After receiving the 800g, Jack goes to the pier and prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2=Try to get it for 500g or you won't buy it.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_s=Seeing that he doesn't seem to have many customers, you manage to convince him to let you have a boat for 500g.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_f=Being a crocoman, he is stubborn, and you do not convince him to lower the price of the boat.<br><br>Since you don't have much else to do, you leave.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_sc=After talking to him for a while, he likes you and gives you a boat for 300g.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp2_fc=The crocoman doesn't take your bargaining offer very well, and asks you to leave the pier before he calls his friends.<br><br>You leave rather humiliated after your attempt to bargain.
e_aquar11_a_rp3=Show the VIP card and pay 400g for the boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp3_s=You show the card to Jack, and he immediately offers you a 50% discount. You pay the 400g, and he prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.
e_aquar11_a_rp4=Tell him Irwin sent you for a free boat.
e_aquar11_a_rp4_s=Jack immediately recognizes Irwin's name as the crocomen leader and his boss. You tell him how you helped conquer the battlefield, and he promised you a boat. Without thinking twice, Jack goes to the dock and prepares a boat for you.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the swamp.
e_aquar13_a_nm=A tough choice
e_aquar13_a_dsc=You arrive at a ravine full of cobwebs and cocoons. Some of the cocoons seem freshly made.<br><br>As you get closer, the cocoons start to shake... There are people inside! The trapped people start screaming when they hear you, begging you to release them.<br><br>You hesitate, as some of them may be starting to mutate, and you can't be sure what their condition is.
e_aquar13_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_aquar13_a_rp0=Ignore the cocoons and go your way.
e_aquar13_a_rp0_s=You leave the place and hear the screaming stop.
e_aquar13_a_rp1=Release the people by opening the cocoons.
e_aquar13_a_rp1_s=First you open the freshest cocoons and release a couple of humans, who both seem healthy. They thank you for what you have done, and one of them places a strange coin in your hand before leaving.<br><br>You open more cocoons, but in these you find two more people who have already mutated. They attack you instantly, and you defend yourself the best you can.
e_aquar13_a_rp2=Kill them without opening the cocoons to spare them from suffering.
e_aquar13_a_rp2_s=You cannot risk opening the cocoons, so you will show mercy and end the suffering of those who are mutating. You use your weapons to pierce the cocoons and kill them.<br><br>This has been an experience that you will not forget.
e_aquar13_a_rp3=Kill them then open the cocoons to loot.
e_aquar13_a_rp3_s=You use your weapons to pierce the cocoons and kill what's inside, then you open them and see some corpses with some useful items and gold.<br><br>As you loot, the other cocoons open by themselves and some mutants appear, immediately attacking you.
e_aquar14_a_nm=Well deserved rest
e_aquar14_a_dsc=You have left the lands of the lizardmen and crocomen behind and are already halfway to the obelisk.<br><br>The area ahead looks even more dangerous, and you can clearly see many spider webs and pools of poison.
e_aquar14_a_dsca=This seems like a good place to rest before continuing.
e_aquar14_a_rp0=Rest and recover some strength.
e_aquar14_a_rp0_s=You feel refreshed.
e_aquar14_a_rp1=You're fine. You look around for shards.
e_aquar14_a_rp1_s=You found many magic shards among some cobwebs. You also found some gold.

e_aquar14_a_rp1_fc=You haven't found anything and have no more time to keep looking.
e_aquar14_a_rp2=I can take care of an injury and try to heal us.
e_aquar14_a_rp2_s=You have time to treat one injury and heal a bit.<br><br>You can remove one card for free from each hero.

e_aquar16_a_nm=The spiders' cave
e_aquar16_a_dsc=You arrive at the entrance to a cave full of cobwebs. It is obvious that all the spiders you have been killing came from this cave.<br><br>You enter the cave, hoping that it has an exit to the other side.<br><br>As you enter, the ground below you begins to collapse.
e_aquar16_a_dsca=You have to try something to avoid falling.
e_aquar16_a_rp0=Try to jump forward together.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_s=You all fall to safety as the ground collapses behind you.<br><br>You get used to the dim light inside the cave and move on.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_sc=You all fall to safety as the ground collapses behind you.<br><br>You get used to the dim light inside the cave and find some magical shards that have been exposed by the collapse.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_f=Some of you do not use enough strength in the jump, and you all fall along with the collapsing floor.<br><br>Luckily, you land on your feet and are not hurt.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp0_fc=Some of you do not use enough force in the jump, and you all fall down along with the collapsing ground.<br><br>When landing, you fall badly and break a bone.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp1=Quickly, grab this rope!
e_aquar16_a_rp1_s=Sylvie reacts instantly and shoots a grappling hook arrow that sticks in the ceiling of the cave.<br><br>Thanks to this, you all avoid falling and reach the solid ground on the other side.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp2=Quick, follow in my footsteps!
e_aquar16_a_rp2_s=Zek has no trouble seeing in the dark and traces a route across the still stable ground before it collapses. The others follow and reach the other side without much trouble.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_a_rp3=Wait here. Do not advance!
e_aquar16_a_rp3_s=The group stops where Thuls indicated, and most of the ground collapses, except for that part and a small ledge next to the cave wall. You advance along it to the other side.<br><br>As you advance you realize that the air inside the cave is poisonous.
e_aquar16_b_nm=rptd_e_aquar16_a_nm
e_aquar16_b_dsc=You arrive at the entrance to a cave full of cobwebs. It is obvious that all the spiders you have been killing came from this cave.<br><br>This is undoubtedly the cave that the figure in the shadows of Senenthia's watermill spoke of.

e_aquar18_a_nm=Altar of songs
e_aquar18_a_dsc=In the southern temple, you see an ancient altar that still seems to have some energy. You hear a soft tone emanating from it.<br><br>Before making an offering, you look around and see a few sirens in the water watching you.<br><br>Everything makes you think that the sirens use this altar, and that it reacts to the sound of their voices.
e_aquar18_a_dsca=Do you want to make an offering?
e_aquar18_a_rp0=Before the sirens get angry, you leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp0_s=You walk away.
e_aquar18_a_rp1=Make a quick offering just as the altar is.
e_aquar18_a_rp1_s=Trying not to anger the sirens, you approach and make a simple offering to the altar.<br><br>As the altar already had some energy saved, you can use it with a discount.
e_aquar18_a_rp2=I will sing a song that I know to overload it
e_aquar18_a_rp2_s=Andrin sings a lullaby from his childhood and tries to match it with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>Surprisingly, it works. The altar is brimming with energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp2_f=Andrin sings a tavern song and does not worry at all about trying to make it resemble the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>The altar loses what little energy it had left, and the infuriated sirens come out of the water and attack you.
e_aquar18_a_rp3=I'll sing a song I know from my homeland
e_aquar18_a_rp3_s=Sylvie sings an elven song with her beautiful voice and effortlessly combines it with the soft tone emanating from the altar.<br><br>It works as expected. The altar is full of energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.

The altar is full of energy and offers you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp5=You sing the ancient song you learned at the owl sanctuary.
e_aquar18_a_rp5_s=You sing the ancient song in chorus.<br><br>Suddenly, the altar shines and overflows with energy like never before, offering you a unique opportunity.<br><br>You can upgrade two cards for free for each hero.
e_aquar18_a_rp6=Place the harpy egg near the altar.
e_aquar18_a_rp6_s=The soft sound emanating from the altar causes the egg to hatch, and a small harpy emerges from it. Mistaking you for her mother, the young harpy begins to follow you.<br><br>Thanks to the harpy, you notice a small chest behind the altar before you leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp7=I will try to corrupt this altar!
e_aquar18_a_rp7_s=Zek casts a curse on the altar, which starts to glow with a dark aura... You can use the altar to try to corrupt one card for each hero.<br><br>Reacting too late to stop him, the nearby sirens leave.
e_aquar18_a_rp7_f=Zek casts a spell on the altar, but it does nothing.<br><br>The altar loses what little energy it had left, and the infuriated sirens come out of the water and attack you.
e_aquar20_a_nm=Snake eyes
e_aquar20_a_dsc=In the central temple, there is large stone statue of a snake coiled between the temple columns. Instead of eyes, the snake statue has two large rubies.<br><br>The statue is protected by several naga wardens with tridents, and they're also protecting an offering chest under the head of the statue.<br><br>Luckily, you hid behind a column and no one has yet noticed your presence.
e_aquar20_a_dsca=How do you want to proceed?

e_aquar20_a_rp0_fc=You advance, hiding behind the columns, believing you are hidden. When you're about to exit, you are hit by a lightning bolt from a warden who saw you.<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_aquar20_a_rp1=You want those rubies. Attack head-on.
e_aquar20_a_rp1_s=Determined to get the rubies, you come out from behind the column and attack the nagas who are protecting them.

e_aquar20_a_rp2_s=You succeed and move between columns without being seen. When you are close enough, you attack them from behind.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_sc=You succeed and move between columns without being seen. You are in the best position to ambush them.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_f=As you move between the columns and get closer, you get distracted by the really big rubies. A stormbringer sees you and casts a lightning spell near you that leaves you a bit stunned and alerts the nagas.<br><br>You have to defend yourself.
e_aquar20_a_rp2_fc=As you move between the columns and get closer, you are distracted by the really big rubies. A stormbringer sees you and casts a lightning spell on you that warns the nagas.<br><br>You have to defend yourself.
e_aquar20_b_nm=Need or greed
e_aquar20_b_dsc=You defeated the nagas protecting the chest and the snake statue with ruby eyes.<br><br>For the moment, there are no more nagas left in the temple, but they will soon return.<br><br>In order to get the rubies, you will have to climb up to the statue and remove them. It will also take some time to loot the chest.
e_aquar20_b_dsca=What do you want to do first?
e_aquar20_b_rp0=Climb up for the rubies and leave the chest.
e_aquar20_b_rp0_s=You climb the stone statue and, with effort, manage to remove the first ruby. It's huge! When you go for the second ruby, you notice that the statue starts to move...

e_aquar20_b_rp1=Loot the chest and leave the rubies.
e_aquar20_b_rp1_s=You open the chest and take everything you find of value. You don't want to waste any more time, and leave before more nagas come.

You don't want to be here when that thing wakes up.
e_aquar20_c_nm=Refugees from the deep
e_aquar20_c_dsc=You arrive at the central temple. Here you find many nagas: the old, the young and the wounded.<br><br>Although they see you, most of them are more concerned about what is in the depths of the water. As you approach, four veteran nagas appear and say to you:<br><br>"We don't want any trouble, so we'll let you pass and give you this huge ruby in exchange for leaving us alone. We're even willing to teach one of you a unique naga combat skill."
e_aquar20_c_dsca=It's hard to say no... Who will be the lucky one?
e_aquar20_c_rp0=You slaughter them all mercilessly.
e_aquar20_c_rp0_s=You ignore their requests and throw yourself into the fray, striking blows left and right.<br><br>The four veteran nagas, though wounded, stand in your way.<br><br>When the fight is over, you will mercilessly kill the remaining nagas that have not returned to the water, and take the ruby.
e_aquar20_c_rp1=You ask for something more tangible besides the ruby.
e_aquar20_c_rp1_s=As they are wounded and don't want any more trouble, they accept.<br><br>They give you some gold and some magic items that are no longer of use to them, in addition to the ruby.<br><br>You take them and leave.
e_aquar20_c_rp2=We accept. Teach it to me!

e_aquar23_a_dsca=Since you are here, take a look at her wares.
e_aquar23_a_rp0=You give her the Belphyor's horn.

e_aquar31_a_rp4_s=Grukli has lived in this area for some time and knows the water current. Before entering the water, he warned you to follow him to avoid danger.
e_aquar31_a_rp5=I'm out of here...
e_aquar31_a_rp5_s=As a lizardman, Thuls has no problem overcoming the current and reaching the shore. Luckily...he has the decency to turn around, grab a nearby branch, and help you out.
e_aquar31_a_rp6=I will use a special arrow to help us out!
e_aquar31_a_rp6_s=Sylvie is always ready with several different arrows. She shoots a grappling hook arrow that sticks in a rock, and you use the rope to get out of the stream.
e_aquar31_a_rp6_f=Sylvie is always ready with several different arrows. She shoots a grappling hook arrow that fails to stick in a nearby rock. Luckily she has a second arrow that does stick, and you use the rope to get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp7=Hold on tight to me!
e_aquar31_a_rp7_s=Bree is very tall and really strong. She has no problem overcoming the current, even having to drag you all with her.
e_aquar31_a_rp8=I had a vision of us falling down the waterfall...
e_aquar31_a_rp8_s=Because Nezglekt warned you beforehand, you were able to avoid the worst, and took the right steps to reach the shore.
e_aquar31_a_rp9=Croak... I will sing to calm the waters!
e_aquar31_a_rp9_s=And surprisingly the waters calmed down... Thanks to Gustav's song, you manage to get out of the dangerous current.
e_aquar31_a_rp10=I will freeze the water to create a path!
e_aquar31_a_rp10_s=Evelyn casts a powerful cold spell. The waters freeze instantly, creating a path you use to get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp10_f=Evelyn casts a spell, but it's not strong enough to freeze all the water. Although it's not what she wanted to do, she manages to create a few chunks of ice that help you get out of the current.
e_aquar31_a_rp11=You tied the rope to a column beforehand just in case.
e_aquar31_a_rp11_s=Seeing the waterfall from afar and noticing that the waters didn't seem safe, you tied the rope to a column to make sure you wouldn't be dragged away. It was a good idea.
e_aquar35_a_nm=Lurking in the water
e_aquar35_a_dsc=To reach the obelisk, you have to cross a pond of water. When you approach, you see something moving underneath.<br><br>Suddenly, four snake-shaped heads appear: it's a hydra! Each head looks a little different from the rest, and you take some time to name them according to their characteristics.<br><br>Since it doesn't move, you can decide how to position yourselves and choose which head you want to stand in front of to fight first.
e_aquar35_a_dsca=If you do not attack immediately, the hydra will have time to prepare.
e_aquar35_a_rp0=Stand in front of Hatred and fight against it. This head seems tougher than the others.
e_aquar35_a_rp0_s=You position yourself in such a way that the head you called Hatred is in front of the others.<br><br>By choosing to quickly engage Hatred, the hydra only has time to prepare itself by improving its physical defenses.

e_aquar35_a_rp1_s=You position yourself in such a way that the head you called Arrogance is in front of the others.<br><br>By choosing to quickly engage Arrogance, the hydra only has time to prepare itself by improving its elemental defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp2=Stand in front of Malice and fight against it. This head seems the most unholy of all.
e_aquar35_a_rp2_s=You position yourself in such a way that the head you called Malice is in front of the others.<br><br>By choosing to quickly engage Malice, the hydra only has time to prepare itself by improving its mystical defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3=Try to rest behind a column before combat.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_s=You manage to rest for a while and regain your strength. By the time you emerge from the column, the hydra has had time to prepare for combat and raise all its defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_sc=You manage to rest for a while and recover all your strength. You are perfectly prepared for combat. When you get out from behind the column, you surprise the hydra, and it does not have time to prepare all its defenses.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_f=You rest for a while, but then one of you accidentally drops their weapon on the ground. The noise alerts Arrogance, who detects you and throws a lightning storm at you. You get out from behind the column and defend yourselves as best you can. The hydra starts the fight fully prepared.
e_aquar35_a_rp3_fc=As you attempt to rest, the Arrogance head detects you and throws a lightning storm at you. You're electrocuted, and the hydra begins the fight fully prepared.
e_aquar35_b_nm=One less headache
e_aquar35_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you manage to defeat the four heads of the hydra!<br><br>Now that you can advance, you discover a large golden chest behind one of the columns.
e_aquar35_b_dsca=You can cross the pond safely and reach the obelisk.
e_aquar35_b_rp0=You open the golden chest.
e_aquar35_b_rp0_s=Inside the chest you find a lot of gold and magic objects. You also plunder the hydra's body, finding magic shards and valuable components.
e_aquar36_a_nm=The Aquarfall obelisk
e_aquar36_a_dsc=You are in front of the obelisk. Like the Senenthia obelisk, this one is also activated and brimming with energy.<br><br>As you did before, you read the obelisk runes aloud. The obelisk wall warps and distorts, creating a new set of portals.
e_aquar36_a_dsca=Which portal do you want to cross?
e_aquar36_a_rp0=Cross the red portal, from which hot air comes out.
e_aquar36_a_rp0_s=You cross the portal, and before you realize it, you are already in another place.

e_aquar36_tier2_nm=rptd_e_aquar36_a_nm
e_aquar36_tier2_dsc=You are in front of the obelisk. This is your third obelisk, but this one is different from the other two. The energy that emanates from it is much greater, and the runes shine with much more intensity.<br><br>With difficulty, you read the obelisk runes aloud. The ground shakes, and the obelisk wall warps; this time, a very large portal is created.<br><br>A blinding white light comes out of the large portal, but it seems harmless.
e_aquar36_tier2_dsca=There is only one place to go. The end of your quest is near.
e_aquar36_tier2_rp0=Cross the large portal.
e_aquar36_tier2_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar36_a_rp0_s
e_aquar37_a_nm=Evading the patrol
e_aquar37_a_dsc=After setting the village on fire, you head south.<br><br>You soon see that a crocoman patrol has left its usual route and is approaching you. They've seen the smoke and are heading quickly to their village to try to put out the fire.<br><br>They haven't seen you yet, and you can try to hide to avoid combat.
e_aquar37_a_dsca=Do you want to hide?
e_aquar37_a_rp0=Confront them now, when they are disorganized.
e_aquar37_a_rp0_s=The crocomen were so concerned with the smoke that they barely saw you on the road, ready to attack them.
e_aquar37_a_rp1=You try to hide in some nearby bushes.
e_aquar37_a_rp1_s=It was difficult for the crocomen to see you, as they were too concerned with the smoke.<br><br>When hiding, you found a few magic shards nearby.

e_aquar37_a_rp1_fc=You hide quite badly, and the crocomen notice you. Suddenly, the furious crocomen are in your hiding place, biting and attacking you. They've assumed you were the cause of the fire.
e_aquar39_a_nm=The wall collapses
e_aquar39_a_dsc=You are passing by a wall that holds back the water from the waterfalls, and it's full of cracks. Suddenly, when you are next to it, the wall starts to give way.<br><br>You have to run as fast as possible or the wall will fall on you. You might even be dragged down by the water current.
e_aquar39_a_dsca=Run, you fools!
e_aquar39_a_rp0=Challenge fate and run quickly.
e_aquar39_a_rp0_s=You run as fast as you can, but the wall is very big and its pieces fall on you. You do your best to dodge them so as not to break any bones, but above all, you protect your head with your arms.<br><br>There is only a small chance of succeeding without getting hurt.
e_aquar39_a_rp0_f=0
e_aquar39_a_rp1=Beep... I will block the wall with my shield.

e_aquar39_b_nm=The master craftsman
e_aquar39_b_dsc=At the edge of the falls, you see an old gnome admiring the view and sighing. You realize that he is Timothy's master. You pass him the message, and he says:<br><br>"I am a skilled craftsman who makes potions, gems and gadgets, but that apprentice of mine is completely useless... I left him there, near the wolves, in the hope that he would give up...or get eaten... Well, I guess it's time to go back to the workshop.<br><br>Mmm...

e_aquar39_b_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_aquar39_b_rp0=You don't want to be his apprentice.

I'm Gustav, the globetrotting minstrel. I had a gig here in the swamp, but some crocomen tricked me into gambling and broke my lute.<br><br>What am I gonna do now without my lute? I can't just play with any instrument. It's gotta be stylish. The only lute similar to mine is in the elven mansion where I played some time ago, in Faeborg...
e_aquar42_b_dsca=Think you can get it for me? I will pay for it."
e_aquar42_b_rp0=You assure him that you will get the lute he wants.
e_aquar42_b_rp0_s=(Gustav) "Thanks, guys... You'll see how well I play!<br><br>Here is some of the money I have raised on my tour. I hope it helps.

e_aquar42_b_rp1=I will help you, Gustav...but I warned you not to sing on this coast.
e_aquar42_b_rp1_s=(Gustav) "You were right, Malukah... Those crocomen bastards came for me, and tricked me into betting... Damn them!<br><br>Thanks for helping me.

As I told you, the lute I want is in one of the elven mansions in Faeborg.<br><br>If you get me it, you will see the rise of the best rock star of this world, and I'll even let you follow me on my next world tour."

e_aquar6_a_nm=An odd war
e_aquar6_a_dsc=On the battlefield, you see the lizardmen fighting against the crocomen. After a while, something catches your attention: this is not a war, but something more organized.

e_faen15_a_dsc=You arrive at a nearby grove of trees, and Bree decides it's a good place to give you a lesson about the forest.<br><br>She is ready to begin the lesson, if you want to hear it.

e_faen15_b_nm=Saving the treants
e_faen15_b_dsc=In a nearby grove you see a humanoid doe. When you approach, it says:<br><br>"Hello, strangers. I am Bree, guardian of the Senenthia forest, and friend of Ylmer... Before he became corrupted, he entrusted me with his seeds, and I came to this forest in the hope that I could plant them. But with the growing cold, I have doubts that they will survive.<br><br>Since I suspect you defeated Ylmer to get here...maybe you could do something for him and me.
e_faen15_b_dsca=I'll give you one of his last seeds if you promise me you'll find a good place to plant it."
e_faen15_b_rp0=You promise Bree that you will protect the seed and find a good place to plant it.
e_faen15_b_rp0_s=Concerned, she entrusts you with one of the few remaining Ylmer seeds.<br><br>Before you leave, she also gives you some magic shards and tells you that she will stay here for a while to make sure the seed can withstand the cold.<br><br>Later, if you plant the seed in a safe place, she will return to the Senentia forest and be willing to help you in the future if you need her help.
e_faen15_b_rp1=You remind me of her... Um, anyway... I promise I will help you.
e_faen15_b_rp1_s=(Bree) "What are you talking about? I don't trust you or your kind... All werewolves are scum.<br><br>However... I'm desperate, and your group seems trustworthy. You may be the exception, so I'm willing to take the risk.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and be sure to plant this seed in a safe place. If you do this for me, I will return to Senenthia and even be willing to give you a chance to explain yourself, werewolf."
e_faen15_b_rp2=Bree? You've really grown since the last time I saw you. Of course I'll help you.
e_faen15_b_rp2_s=(Bree) "Andrin! I'm so glad to see you again. Thank you for playing with me when I was young and comforting me when my mother died...<br><br>As you can see, the situation is dire, and I need your help. As guardian of the forest, and in honor of Ylmer, I need to plant his seeds.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and help me plant the last seed in a safe place. If you do, I'll be able to return to Senenthia and help you with whatever you need."
e_faen15_b_rp3=I'm glad to see you found the grove. Now I can help you.
e_faen15_b_rp3_s=(Bree) "Ohh, you are the young elf who showed me the way when I came to this forest. Thank you very much.<br><br>I see that now you are free to go wherever you want... I, on the other hand, still have to stay here. The cold threatens my purpose, and I need your help once again.<br><br>Take these magic shards as thanks, and be sure to plant this seed somewhere safe. If you do this for me, I will be able to move freely again. I'll be able to return to my forest in Senenthia and help you with whatever you need."
e_faen15_b_rp4=You tell her that you don't have time to be a gardener.
e_faen15_b_rp4_s=She seems quite angry with you for not wanting to take on this responsibility after defeating Ylmer.<br><br>Still, she turns back to the grove and lets you go.
e_faen16_a_nm=The owl sanctuary
e_faen16_a_dsc=You arrive at a large tree that appears to be an owl sanctuary. As you approach, the elf guarding the place says to you:<br><br>"Ohh! What good timing... I really need your help. The intense cold is agitating the owls... We usually sing them an ancient song to calm them down, but the other elves are busy with the owl guardians.<br><br>I can teach you that ancient song, and even give you some magic shards, if you help me calm them down."
e_faen16_a_dsca=Do you want to learn and sing the ancient song?
e_faen16_a_rp0=You tell him you don't have time to sing, and leave.
e_faen16_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen16_a_rp1=You try to sing the ancient song in chorus.
e_faen16_a_rp1_s=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp1_sc=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is a resounding success!

e_faen16_a_rp1_f=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is not good enough!

e_faen16_a_rp1_fc=The elf teaches you the ancient song, and after a while, everyone starts singing...<br><br>Your interpretation is really bad! The owls are furious and start clawing at you, causing several wounds. The infuriated angry elf asks you to leave before things get even more complicated.<br><br>At least you've learned the ancient song.
e_faen16_a_rp2=I can try to sing it along with the elf...
e_faen16_a_rp2_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Andrin, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success! The owls fly in a circle above him and give him their blessing. When the song ends, the owls calm down and return to their nests.<br><br>The elf is very grateful and gives you a lot of magic shards.
e_faen16_a_rp2_f=The elf teaches the ancient song to Andrin, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is really bad!

e_faen16_a_rp3_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Thuls, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp3_f=The elf teaches the ancient song to Thuls, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is really bad!

e_faen16_a_rp4=A new song! Yeahh! I want to learn it and sing it!
e_faen16_a_rp4_s=The elf teaches the ancient song to Gustav, and after a while, they both start singing...<br><br>His interpretation is a success!

e_faen16_a_rp5=I'll sing it myself. I've done it several times before.
e_faen16_a_rp5_s=Sylvie already knows the song, as she often came to the sanctuary to train with her pet. Sylvie and the elf already know each other, and the two sing the song together.<br><br>The owls fly in a circle above her and give her their blessing. When the song ends, the owls calm down and return to their nests.<br><br>The elf thanks Sylvie and gives her a lot of magic shards.
e_faen17_a_nm=The owl guardian
e_faen17_a_dsc=You come to a large owl statue. It seems that the elves use these statues to protect the forest from the growing cold.
e_faen17_a_dsca=The statue seems to be in good condition and working properly. There is not much else you can do here for the moment.
e_faen17_a_rp0=You continue on your way and ignore the statue.
e_faen17_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen17_a_rp1=Wait here. Let me check something.
e_faen17_a_rp1_s=Sylvie does a routine check of the statue and then looks around.<br><br>After a while, she returns with a few magic shards and a depleted magic sapphire. The sapphire still seems to be quite expensive.
e_faen17_b_nm=The depleted guardian
e_faen17_b_dsc=You come to a large owl statue that the elves use to protect the forest from the cold, but it seems to be malfunctioning. As you approach, you see a young elf who says to you:<br><br>"What are you doing in this forest? You shouldn't be here... The magic stone that powers this owl guardian is almost depleted. When its energy runs out, the cold will grow, and the dead will advance into the sanctuary.<br><br>As an elf, it is my duty to stay and protect the sanctuary... If only I had another magic stone, or something to replace it!
e_faen17_b_dsca=I'm sorry, but you must leave before it's too late."
e_faen17_b_rp0=You give her the moonstone you stole from the elder dryad.
e_faen17_b_rp0_s=(Elf) "Ohh, this is perfect! Just what I needed. This magic stone is even better than ours; it seems to recharge at night.<br><br>By the way, I'm Sylvie. Thanks to you, I can now leave the forest in peace. I have some personal business to finish first, but after that you can count on me for whatever you want.<br><br>Before you go, accept these magic shards and this sapphire that powered the owl guardian. Although it's almost depleted, I'm sure it still has a lot of value."
e_faen17_b_rp1=You can't help her. You listen to her and leave.
e_faen17_b_rp1_s=The young elf bids you farewell as she leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen17_b_rp2=Elf... The city is frozen, and the forest will fall soon... You should leave, too.
e_faen17_b_rp2_s=(Elf) "I know about the city... I've been there... But even so, I must stay.<br><br>Thanks for the advice, I guess... Take these magic shards. I'm sure they will be of more use to you than to me."<br><br>As you leave, the elf leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen17_b_rp3=I can see how we'll beat the cold...but I can't help you right now.
e_faen17_b_rp3_s=(Elf) "Thank you for trying to give me hope...but without the active owl guardian, it will be too late for the sanctuary.<br><br>Anyway... Take these magic shards. I'm sure they will be of more use to you than to me."<br><br>As you leave, the elf leans against the statue to rest.
e_faen18_a_nm=The Happy Owl
e_faen18_a_dsc=You arrive at the Happy Owl inn and notice that the inn has a very peculiar tricolor flag on the door.<br><br>Inside the inn, the atmosphere is cold despite the lit fireplace. The faces of the few elves sheltering from the cold do not look very happy.<br><br>The innkeeper approaches you, asking what brings you here, and if you need anything.
e_faen18_a_dsca=This might be a good time to rest or get some information.
e_faen18_a_rp0=You tell her you just need to get some rest.
e_faen18_a_rp0_s=As she doesn't have many customers, the innkeeper lets you rest for a while before you continue on your way.
e_faen18_a_rp1=You pay her 400g to serve you something.
e_faen18_a_rp1_s=She brings you some food and drinks, and you rest until you are back to full health.
e_faen18_a_rp2=You pay her 1,600g to have a big feast.
e_faen18_a_rp2_s=She brings you the best food and drinks she has, in large quantities. You also invite the rest of the elves of the inn to cheer them up a bit.<br><br>It was a good feast, and you are fully rested.
e_faen18_a_rp3=You ask her what happened here. Why is everything frozen?
e_faen18_a_rp3_s=(Innkeeper) "It all happened a few days ago, when the dormant obelisk was suddenly activated. Soon after, the Frost Calamity descended from the skies and, with its arrival, instantly froze half the city.<br><br>We were lucky to be outside the walls...but now, to make matters worse, there are rumors that the frozen dead are rising inside the city."<br><br>Thanks to this valuable information, you decide to prepare yourselves thoroughly against the cold (+8% cold resistance).
e_faen18_a_rp4=You ask her if she knows the owner of this old journal.
e_faen18_a_rp4_s=(Innkeeper) "That is my grandfather's diary... If you have it, I guess he passed away in the pursuit of his dream.<br><br>You see, my grandfather founded this inn and gave it the tricolor flag with his three favorite colors: green, yellow and blue. He was a great merchant, and he always used to tell me about a magic circle somewhere in the world with colored runes. According to him, putting the colors on our flag would fulfill the dreams of any merchant.<br><br>Thank you for returning his diary. Please rest as much as you need, and take these magic shards."
e_faen19_a_nm=Closed sewers
e_faen19_a_dsc=You arrive at the outlet of the city sewer, which is closed by a barred gate.<br><br>You take a look inside the sewers, and it seems that everything is frozen. You seem to see something moving...
e_faen19_a_dsca=The gate appears to be firmly closed.
e_faen19_a_rp0=You don't want to enter the sewers.
e_faen19_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_faen19_a_rp1=Let's go inside. I have the key.
e_faen19_a_rp1_s=Zek reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small key with which he unlocks the barred gate.<br><br>You decide to enter the sewers.<br><br>The cold inside the sewers is extreme. You must hurry or you will freeze to death.
e_faen19_b_nm=The exiled
e_faen19_b_dsc=You arrive at the outlet of the city sewer, which is closed by a barred gate. Here you find a ratman who seems to be desperately searching for something. As you approach, you hear him say:<br><br>"Without the key, there's no point in going in!

e_secta1_a_nm=Silly gatekeepers
e_secta1_a_dsc=You are inside the hatch. Here you can see what at first glance seems to be a normal basement, but at the end of the room, you can see a door with three pigmen keeping watch.<br><br>They are new to this place and don't seem very excited about having to stand guard. In fact, one of them is lying down and almost asleep.<br><br>The other two don't seem to be very smart either, but they could raise the alarm depending on how you approach.
e_secta1_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_secta1_a_rp0=Clearly, this is not a normal basement. You leave now, while you still can.
e_secta1_a_rp0_s=You climb the stairs back to the surface.
e_secta1_a_rp1=Charge at them directly so they can't call reinforcements.
e_secta1_a_rp1_s=They are surprised to see you here, and only have time to grab a torch to defend themselves. The one sleeping barely has time to wake up.
e_secta1_a_rp2=Act as if you were one of them, and go ahead.
e_secta1_a_rp2_s=Since they are new recruits, and you are already in the basement, they did not doubt you for a moment. They open the door for you, and you go inside.
e_secta1_a_rp2_sc=As they are new recruits, and you are already in the basement, they have not doubted for a moment. They open the door and give you a small bag of gold that they say you left behind when you left last time.
e_secta1_a_rp2_f=Your attempt to impersonate one of them has gone wrong, and you are discovered.<br><br>As you see that you are discovered, you have no choice but to fight.
e_secta1_a_rp2_fc=Though they're new recruits, you have overdone your attempt to impersonate being one of them, and they discover you.<br><br>They torch your ass as you try to pass by, and the fight begins.
e_secta1_a_rp3=Make a noise to distract two of them, and use the old rope to tie the one sleeping.
e_secta1_a_rp3_s=You tie the half-asleep pigman and move him aside while the other two are distracted.<br><br>When they turn to the door, it is too late, and you are already on them.
e_secta1_a_rp4=They don't seem very smart. Let me try to intimidate them.
e_secta1_a_rp4_s=Magnus appeared from the shadows before the pigmen, with a grim look and showing his fangs.<br><br>He didn't have to say anything. When they saw him, the pigmen ran hastily past the rest of the group and climbed up the hatch without thinking twice.<br><br>You found a small gold sack where the pigman was sleeping.
e_secta1_a_rp4_f=It's hard for Magnus to pretend to be a wild werewolf, and the pigmen realize this after a brief scare.<br><br>They abruptly attack him with the torches, and the fight begins.
e_secta1_a_rp5=I will show them this staff and order them to let us pass.
e_secta1_a_rp5_s=Fortunately, one of them recognizes the staff. They bow to Cornelius and open the door for you.
e_secta1_a_rp5_f=The pigmen do not recognize the staff or Cornelius. Perhaps the recruits are too new, or maybe it is Cornelius's fault...thinking he is someone else again.<br><br>While Cornelius is confused and lost in his thoughts, they prepare to fight.
e_secta1_a_rp6=I can easily put these simpletons to sleep.
e_secta1_a_rp6_s=Nezglekt casts a spell, and all the pigmen instantly fall asleep on the ground. You take advantage of the fact that they are asleep to steal a small bag of gold and cross the door.
e_secta1_a_rp7=I will convince them to return to the right path and leave this place.
e_secta1_a_rp7_s=Ottis approaches the pigmen and gives them a good lecture. After a while, he seems to convince them, and they leave the basement.<br><br>Ottis returns to the group with a big smile on his face, and on top of that, he has been given a bag of gold as a thank you.
e_secta1_a_rp7_f=Ottis approaches the pigmen and gives them a good lecture, but something goes wrong, and the pigmen get upset about something Ottis has said.<br><br>Suddenly they attack him with the torches, and the fight starts.
e_secta4_a_nm=The bottomless pit
e_secta4_a_dsc=Moving next to the big pit in the middle of the room, you come to a ledge.<br><br>Clearly, those cultists are throwing something in there...but you're not sure what it could be.<br><br>The hole looks really deep, and you can't see the bottom. Plus, there is no apparent way down.
e_secta4_a_dsca=Do you want to try throwing something?
e_secta4_a_rp0=You don't know what to throw, and maybe it's for the best.
e_secta4_a_rp0_s=You ignore the pit and move on.
e_secta4_a_rp1=Go closer and stare at the dark bottom of the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp1_s=With your eyes wide open, you try to see the bottom.<br><br>When you are getting used to the darkness, you suddenly notice that something is staring back at you.
e_secta4_a_rp2=Throw a group member into the pit. Fate will decide who it is.
e_secta4_a_rp2_s=You push the unlucky one into the hole. The drop is long...but after a while, they are magically teleported back to the group. Whatever is at the bottom didn't like what you threw.<br><br>This was an unforgettable and very traumatic experience.
e_secta4_a_rp2_f=You hear screams for a while and feel a little remorse, but just a little.
e_secta4_a_rp3=You remember tying up a pigman at the entrance...
e_secta4_a_rp3_s=You went to get him, and you untied the poor pigman on the ledge, saving the rope for another time. Without any remorse, you push the pigman into the pit.<br><br>After a while, you hear a strange and deep voice in a language you cannot understand. You feel a powerful energy that emanates from the pit and surrounds you.<br><br>You discovered what cultists throw into the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp4=I can feel a powerful dark being at the bottom. I will try to communicate.
e_secta4_a_rp4_s=Zek speaks in the language of the dark gods to try to get an answer...<br><br>The answer doesn't come, but whatever is inside the pit considers Zek worthy. A strange energy comes out of the pit and surrounds him.
e_secta4_a_rp4_f=Zek speaks in the language of the dark gods to try to get an answer...<br><br>The answer doesn't come, but whatever is inside the pit considers Zek unworthy, and a loud grunt comes from the pit.
e_secta4_a_rp5=I will absorb a small part of the dark energy of the pit for myself.
e_secta4_a_rp5_s=Malukah carefully manipulates a part of the dark energy emanating of the pit and makes it her own.
e_secta5_a_nm=The summoning ritual
e_secta5_a_dsc=You reach the end of the basement, and here you can see many cultists in a summoning circle.<br><br>The summoning has begun, and from the number of cultists, it does not seem like just a normal imp will show up.<br><br>They become aware of your presence near the ritual, and some cultists leave the circle to confront you.
e_secta5_a_dsca=The cultist looks at you suspiciously, waiting for an answer.
e_secta5_a_rp0=You respond by drawing your weapons and striking first.
e_secta5_a_rp0_s=They react a little slowly, and you start the fight with some advantage.
e_secta5_a_rp1=Tell them you are new here, and you've come to help with the ritual.
e_secta5_a_rp1_s=You are in their basement and at the ritual, so after a brief moment of doubt, they let you join.
e_secta5_a_rp1_sc=They welcome you with open arms and give you several magic shards to help them finish the ritual.
e_secta5_a_rp1_f=They look at you a second time and clearly see that you don't belong here.<br><br>You didn't fool them, and the fight begins.
e_secta5_a_rp1_fc=They look at you a second time and laugh in your face... It was too obvious that you were not one of them. You prepare to fight.
e_secta5_a_rp2=You fools! You don't know what you're doing. Stop this at once!
e_secta5_a_rp2_s=The nearby cultist recognizes Cornelius immediately. They bow down and leave, but it is too late, and the ritual is about to end.
e_secta5_a_rp2_f=Only one of the cultists recognizes Cornelius. When he sees no reaction from his comrades, he flees from the fight that is about to begin.
e_secta5_a_rp3=I am a specialist in this sort of ritual. Let me help you.
e_secta5_a_rp3_s=They don't need to look at Zek twice to know he's telling the truth. Since you are already there, they see no problem in letting you help with the ritual.
e_secta5_b_nm=Lord of the imps
e_secta5_b_dsc=The ritual ended, the room filled with red smoke, and the temperature rose rapidly. You don't know if it went well or not, but all the remaining cultists start to flee in panic after realizing what they've done.<br><br>An impressive imp appears before you. It's the greater demon Belphyor, the Lord of the Imps.<br><br>(Belphyor) "What do you want from me, mortal?"
e_secta5_b_dsca=Although he's been weakened by the precarious summoning conditions, you can't underestimate him.
e_secta5_b_rp0=Well... We were just passing through, killing cultists... Can we leave?
e_secta5_b_rp0_s=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>Well, I'll allow you to leave."<br><br>You leave the basement before he changes his mind.
e_secta5_b_rp0_sc=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>Well, I'll allow you to leave."<br><br>You leave the basement before he changes his mind. On your way out, you pick up a few magic shards from the bodies of the dead cultists.
e_secta5_b_rp0_f=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>But I am afraid you killed lots of imps in the process, so I cannot allow you to leave."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp0_fc=(Belphyor) "Ha ha ha... That's a good one... I can clearly see that you are not one of those pesky cultists, and that you can use your brain.<br><br>But don't take me for a fool."<br><br>Belphyor throws a fire spell at you before you can react, and you suffer burns. You defend yourself the best you can.
e_secta5_b_rp1=He is weakened. Now is a good chance to defeat him forever. Attack him.
e_secta5_b_rp1_s=(Belphyor) "Fool..."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp2=Oh, great Belphyor... Maybe there is something we can do for you?
e_secta5_b_rp2_s=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslave my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>Here's the deal: take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists. It will summon a horde of imps, and they will take revenge without being controlled.<br><br>Do this and you will be greatly rewarded."<br><br>You get the scroll and leave the basement.
e_secta5_b_rp2_sc=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>Here's the deal: take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists. It will summon a horde of imps, and they will take revenge without being controlled.<br><br>Do this and you will be greatly rewarded."<br><br>You get the scroll, and on your way out, you collect some magic shards from the dead cultists.
e_secta5_b_rp2_f=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>But there is no way I'll let you live after all the imps you have slaughtered."<br><br>The fight begins.
e_secta5_b_rp2_fc=(Belphyor) "Interesting... You don't seem to be one of those cultists who enslaves my kind by summoning us whenever they like.<br><br>But don't take me for a fool."<br><br>Belphyor throws a fire spell at you before you can react, and you suffer burns. You defend yourself the best you can.
e_secta5_b_rp3=Hello...old friend... We meet again.
e_secta5_b_rp3_s=(Belphyor) "I see you're still alive... And you dare to call me old friend? Last time, you summoned me into the depths of that damned forge and then abandoned me to my fate. You owe me one, and now is the perfect time to repay me.<br><br>Your former followers are using my imps as mere tools... They've had enough, and now they're out for revenge. Take this scroll and use it in a place full of cultists.<br><br>Do this for me, and we'll be even. Plus, I'll reward you generously."
e_secta5_c_nm=A great feat
e_secta5_c_dsc=You have defeated a greater demon!<br><br>Although he has not died, he's returned to his plane of existence and will take time to recover. Still, it is a great achievement that must be celebrated.<br><br>There should be some magic shards in the demon's remains, and now that the basement is empty of cultists, you can loot it.
e_secta5_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_secta5_c_rp0=Loot the basement and get some rest.
e_secta5_c_rp0_s=You collect all the magic shards and also find a hidden chest near the summoning circle.<br><br>One of the greater demon's horns remained after the fight. You take it as a trophy and proof of your deed.<br><br>You open the chest and rest for a while.
e_secta6_a_nm=The imp altar
e_secta6_a_dsc=At the end of the hall you find a large stone statue of an imp.<br><br>Although the placement of this statue is suspicious, it's clear that it is used as an altar of some kind.<br><br>You've found imps before wandering around freely, and this statue may have something to do with it.
e_secta6_a_dsca=What do you want to do?
e_secta6_a_rp0=You do not want to touch this altar and be surrounded by imps by accident.
e_secta6_a_rp0_s=You ignore the altar and move on.
e_secta6_a_rp1=Carefully, you inspect the statue to find something unusual.
e_secta6_a_rp1_s=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer examination, you discover that those stones are buttons.<br><br>You press the one that looks more used, and a secret door opens behind the statue.
e_secta6_a_rp1_sc=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer inspection, you discover that these stones are buttons.<br><br>You press the one that seems to be the most used, and a secret door opens behind the statue, as well as a small compartment on the statue containing magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp1_f=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer examination, you discover that those stones are buttons, but it is too late because you've already pressed some of them in the process.<br><br>A secret door opened behind the statue, but it also activated the altar, which begins to summon imps.
e_secta6_a_rp1_fc=You notice some small loose stones on the statue. Upon closer inspection, you discover that those stones are buttons, but it's too late because you've already pressed some of them in the process.<br><br>A secret door opened behind the statue, but it also activated the altar, which starts summoning imps that quickly surround you. The imps attack you with fire, causing you burns, and now you have to defend yourself.
e_secta6_a_rp2=Smash the statue so that it can no longer be used.
e_secta6_a_rp2_s=You gather all your strength and break the statue with a single blow.<br><br>In the remains of the statue you discover lots of magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp2_sc=You gather all your strength and break the statue with a single blow.<br><br>When you break the statue, a secret door is activated behind it. In the remains of the statue you discover a bunch of magic shards.
e_secta6_a_rp2_f=Your attacks leave some marks on the statue, but they are not strong enough to break it with one blow.<br><br>The blows activate the statue, which begins to summon imps.
e_secta6_a_rp2_fc=Your attacks leave some marks on the statue, but they are not strong enough to break it with one blow.<br><br>The blows activate the statue, which begins to summon imps. They attack you with fire, causing you burns, and now you have to defend yourself.
e_secta6_a_rp3=I know how to best use these imp altars.
e_secta6_a_rp3_s=Cornelius chants something nearly inaudible and casts a fire spell on the altar.<br><br>Surprisingly, the altar shines, and a secret door opens behind it.<br><br>Also, you can now use this altar to upgrade one card for free.
e_secta6_a_rp4=Ask the pigman you tied up at the entrance how this works.
e_secta6_a_rp4_s=You promise the pigman that you will free him if he tells you how this altar works.<br><br>He goes behind the statue and presses a button. A secret door suddenly opens.<br><br>As promised, you untie the pigman and keep the old rope. The pigman runs off towards the exit.
e_secta6_a_rp5=Let me examine this statue in detail.
e_secta6_a_rp5_s=Wilbur approaches the statue and examines it carefully. After a while, you hear a "click" and a secret door opens behind the statue.
e_secta7_a_nm=An ephemeral potion
e_secta7_a_dsc=The secret door takes you to a room with a large chest.<br><br>You open the chest and find some items that might be useful. Among them, a bright orange potion catches your eye.<br><br>As soon as you take the potion out of the chest, its contents begin to disappear. You don't know if it is drinkable, but there is no time, and only one can drink it before it completely vanishes.
e_secta7_a_dsca=Who will drink it?
e_secta7_a_rp0=None of you feel like drinking an unidentified potion found in a basement.
e_secta7_a_rp0_s=You ignore the potion and collect the other items in the chest.
e_secta7_a_rp1=Let fate decide who will drink it.
e_secta7_a_rp1_s=When you drink the potion, you notice your body warming up.<br><br>After a brief moment, you feel a surge of energy within you, and your body temperature drops again. You do not know exactly why, but you believe that this phenomenon will repeat itself again.
e_secta7_a_rp1_f=You take the rest of the items in the chest.
e_secta7_a_rp2=I will drink it.
e_secta7_a_rp2_s=When you drink the potion, you notice your body warming up.<br><br>After a brief moment, you feel a surge of energy within you, and your body temperature drops again. You do not know exactly why, but you believe that this phenomenon will repeat itself again.<br><br>You take the rest of the items in the chest.
e_secta8_a_nm=Leaving the basement
e_secta8_a_dsc=After resting for a while and thoroughly inspecting the basement, there is nothing left to do here.
e_secta8_a_dsca=Now you can get out of the basement.
e_secta8_a_rp0=You leave the basement.
e_secta8_a_rp0_s=You walk through the basement full of dead cultists and exit.
e_demoend_nm=End of Demo
e_demoend_dsc=Thank you for playing Across the Obelisk Demo.<br><br>The final game will have 4 acts, more heroes to unlock, more events, more items, different kinds of nodes and much more!!<br><br>You will now get a reward, and you can try the demo again, craft something in the town and try a different path!
e_demoend_dsca=If you have any suggestions or want to leave your feedback, you can do so at our Discord.
e_demoend_rp0=Finish the demo.
e_demoend_rp0_s=continue
e_sen12_a_nm=The hatch
e_sen12_a_dsc=You come across a house in ruins, and inside you see a large hatch.<br><br>You try to open the hatch, but it is properly closed. A few seconds later, a voice speaks to you through the hatch:<br><br>"Only those touched by the flames..."<br><br>Then the voice remains silent, as if waiting for a passphrase.
e_sen12_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_sen12_a_rp0=You don't know the passphrase, so you leave.
e_sen12_a_rp0_s=You walk away from the hatch.
e_sen12_a_rp1=Jumping on the hatch will break it. The problem will be trying to land on your feet.
e_sen12_a_rp1_s=A perfect landing, and nothing seems to be broken.
e_sen12_a_rp1_f=Ouch... The impact of the fall was too strong for you, and something broke.
e_sen12_a_rp2=Try to open the hatch in a safer way than jumping on it.
e_sen12_a_rp2_s=You find a small opening in the hatch, and using your weapons as a crowbar, you manage to open it.
e_sen12_a_rp2_sc=You search around the ruined house and find a hidden note with the passphrase, and a bag with a few magic shards.<br><br>You go back to the hatch, and when you say the passphrase, they open it for you.
e_sen12_a_rp2_f=You have taken too long to find the way to open the hatch. You hear how the people inside reinforce the hatch after not hearing the answer passphrase.<br><br>You don't want to waste any more time here and leave.
e_sen12_a_rp2_fc=It takes you too long to find a way to open the hatch, and a pigman patrol has returned. They see you desperately trying to open it, and laugh at you as they prepare to attack.<br><br>You hear the hatch close further. There's nothing you can do about it.
e_sen12_a_rp3=Hmm... That sounds very familiar. Let me remember...
e_sen12_a_rp3_s=Cornelius thinks for a while and says:<br><br>"Only those touched by the flames...can see beyond the burning hand."<br><br>Then he mutters under his breath to you that he thinks he remembers that he was the one who invented this nonsense... The hatch opens.
e_sen12_a_rp3_f=rptd_e_aquar39_a_rp0_f
e_sen12_a_rp4=I can try to read their minds and find out.
e_sen12_a_rp4_s=Nezglekt concentrates on those behind the hatch to try to figure out the passphrase. After a while, he doesn't even need to say it, as he manages to control one of them to open the hatch directly.
e_sen12_a_rp4_f=Nezglekt concentrates on those behind the hatch to try to figure out the passphrase. After a while, he discovers nothing, as he can't see them and can't concentrate on a specific individual.<br><br>There is nothing more you can do. You have already wasted too much time here, so you leave.
e_sen13_a_nm=The new recruits
e_sen13_a_dsc=You have reached a crossroads: to the north the path leads to an old watchtower, to the south the path leads you to the bridges that cross the river.<br><br>The northern path appears to be blocked by a pigman with a brand on his arm who is trying to recruit others for what appears to be a cult.<br><br>If you want to go north, you will have to deal with them.
e_sen13_a_dsca=How would you like to proceed?
e_sen13_a_rp0=Forget about the north path and go south.
e_sen13_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_faen3_a_rp0_s
e_sen13_a_rp1=You attack them to clear the way.
e_sen13_a_rp1_s=You approach them quickly and catch them off guard. The marked pigman summons a fire imp, and the fight begins.
e_sen13_a_rp2=Tell them to disappear from your sight and clear the way.
e_sen13_a_rp2_s=The poor recruits run away, and the other pigman, who sees how he has been left alone, also leaves.<br><br>They left in a hurry and forgot to take a bag of gold and some shards.
e_sen13_a_rp2_sc=The threat scared them so much that, before they leave, they ask for your forgiveness and give you everything they have, to make sure you don't come after them.<br><br>Among their things is some gold, a few shards and some items that might be useful to you.
e_sen13_a_rp2_f=You have frightened only one of the recruits who runs away... The other recruit stays and prepares to fight.<br><br>Meanwhile, the marked pigman summons a fire imp and attacks you.
e_sen13_a_rp2_fc=They ignore your threats and instantly throw a couple of torches at you, causing your clothes to start burning and giving you small burns.<br><br>You have no choice but to defend yourself as best you can.
e_sen13_a_rp3=I will scare them by pretending to be a savage werewolf.
e_sen13_a_rp3_s=Magnus howled fiercely and charged at them with a wild look.<br><br>The poor pigmen didn't think twice and ran without looking back.<br><br>They left behind all their belongings. Maybe you can find something useful.
e_sen13_a_rp3_f=Magnus howled fiercely and the pigmen shuddered, but then pulled themselves together at the sight of Magnus's refined mustache and clean fur.<br><br>They throw a torch at Magnus's face, and the branded pigman summons a fire imp while preparing to fight.
e_sen13_a_rp4=Oink... These poor fellow pigmen have lost their way in life. Let me enlighten them.
e_sen13_a_rp4_s=Ottis approaches the pigmen and begins a long conversation.<br><br>When he's done speaking, both the branded pigman and the recruits thank him and leave.<br><br>They left all their belongings behind. Maybe you can find something you can use.
e_sen13_a_rp4_f=Ottis approaches the pigmen and begins a long conversation.<br><br>Something didn't go well, and in the middle of the talks, one of the recruits leaves, but the other throws a torch at Ottis's face.<br><br>The branded pigman summons a fire imp and attacks you.
e_sen13_a_rp5=I think I recognize that brand... I will order them to stay away.
e_sen13_a_rp5_s=With a dignified pose, Cornelius approaches the pigmen.<br><br>When they see him, the pigmen bow down... Perhaps they have mistaken him for one of their own...

e_sen15_a_rp0_s=When you leave, you hear the sound of something crawling in that cavity.

e_sen17_b_dsc=When you cross the bridges, an old man who rests to one side looks at you and says:<br><br>"Hello, young ones...

I remember I had a spare one that I used in my younger days... It was a very special staff imbued with fire magic, but I left it far from here.<br><br>If you get the staff back for me...

e_sen17_b_rp0=You offer him your help and ask him where you can find his old staff.
e_sen17_b_rp0_s=(Old man) "Let me remember... I used to be in a special group of people... Maybe one of them has my staff, or they keep it for me in case I come back.

I don't quite remember why, but one day I went away and left my staff with them. I'm sure my old staff is still at their main base.<br><br>Thank you for helping this old man. Take these magic shards as thanks."
e_sen17_b_rp2=Cornelius? It's me, Wilbur. Don't you remember an old friend?
e_sen17_b_rp2_s=(Cornelius) "Wilbur...mmm... Ha! Now I remember! It's been too long since the dwarf revolt at the Black Forge.<br><br>As you see, I am already very old, and unlike you... I need a good staff to get around. I left my old staff at the main base of the Burning Hand, in the Velkarath mountains. Could you go get it for me, please?<br><br>Thanks for helping me, old friend. Take these magic shards as thanks."
e_sen17_b_rp3=Tell him you don't have time to listen to his stories.

e_sen18_a_rp3=Hello, brother, show me how much you have improved.

e_sen18_b_rp2=I will howl fiercely to scare those pigmen.

Oink... That the werewolves didn't find... Take what you need.<br><br>Thank you... Oink... And make sure you take the road that leads north through the Forest Border."
e_sen21_b_rp1=Ottis, calm down, what are you doing here? Are you sure it was Yogger who did this?
e_sen21_b_rp1_s=(Ottis) "Magnus! Thank God it's you. You gave me quite a scare... Oink. I came back when I found out my pigmen brothers were being recruited by a strange cult. So I settled in this chapel... Oink...and I do sermons to dissuade them from joining the cult.<br><br>Yogger found out and sent his werewolves after me. He's still obsessed with eating me. Oink. Please help me, Magnus. Yogger leads his werewolves from the bandit camp in the north of the forest.<br><br>I have some things here that they didn't find... Oink, take what you need."
e_sen21_b_rp2=You tell the supposed priest that you don't have time for his delusions.
e_sen21_b_rp2_s=As you leave the chapel you hear the priest crying in a corner.<br><br>(Priest) "Noooo... Oink... Oink...<br><br>Oink... I'm dead meat."
e_sen22_a_nm=The fang gates
e_sen22_a_dsc=You are entering the northern part of the forest. The fang gates guarding the bandit camp stand before you and the path ahead will not be easy.<br><br>Now is the perfect time to rest or prepare for the battle ahead.<br><br>Remember that you don't have much time to spare, so you can only do one activity before continuing.
e_sen22_a_dsca=What will it be?
e_sen22_a_rp0=Relax and recover some strength.
e_sen22_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar14_a_rp0_s

e_sen22_a_rp1_sc=Below a suspicious trunk you found a hidden cache of the bandits and a small chest.
e_sen22_a_rp1_f=Time's up. You don't have more time to wander in the forest, but at least you have recovered some magic shards from it.
e_sen22_a_rp1_fc=While searching for shards, you got too close to the camp and a patrol found you.
e_sen22_a_rp2=I found a forest trail here. Maybe it can lead us directly into the bandit camp.
e_sen22_a_rp2_s=Andrin's tracking skills where on point.<br><br>The trail leads to the bandit camp and now you can take it.<br><br>Also you found some shards and had time to rest a bit.

e_sen24_a_nm=The apprentice craftsman
e_sen24_a_dsc=Hiding behind a tree, you find a gnome fiddling with a couple of gadgets. You approach him and ask him what he is doing there.<br><br>"Hi, I'm Timothy. I'm waiting for my master...but it's been several days since he left me here...and I'm beginning to think he has abandoned me.<br><br>I know I'm not a good apprentice and my inventions tend to backfire...but I'd like him to come back. Please, if you see him, tell him I'm going back to the workshop.<br><br>By the way, if you want, you can keep any of my inventions."
e_sen24_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_sen24_a_rp0=If you see his master, you will give him the message.
e_sen24_a_rp0_s=After hearing you, the gnome gathers his things and leaves, leaving behind many of his gadgets.<br><br>You search through them to see if there is anything you can use.
e_sen24_a_rp1=You don't have time for this nonsense.
e_sen24_a_rp1_s=You ignore the gnome and continue on your way.
e_sen25_a_nm=Story time!
e_sen25_a_dsc=In the forest, you found a large open space that seems like the perfect place to rest a bit before continuing your journey.<br><br>As you go to set up camp, you notice a group of werewolves camping. They see you and offer to share the camp, one of them also says to you:<br><br>"Hey, do you want to share some stories from your travels with us while we rest?"
e_sen25_a_dsca=Do you want to share their camp and tell them a story?
e_sen25_a_rp0=You don't want to waste time with strangers in the middle of the forest.
e_sen25_a_rp0_s=When you say no, you hear them growl a little, but they stay in their camp and you leave.
e_sen25_a_rp1=Vaguely tell them you want to reach the obelisk.
e_sen25_a_rp1_s=You tell them without much detail that you want to get to the obelisk. After that you go to rest and when you wake up, they have already left.<br><br>You feel refreshed.
e_sen25_a_rp1_sc=Although you tell them your story without much detail, they like it and they tell you that they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in the -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp1_f=You tell them your story and go to sleep peacefully. Luckily, you were alert and you discover them taking their weapons and preparing to attack you in the middle of the night.<br><br>You try to defend yourselves.
e_sen25_a_rp1_fc=You tell them the story and go to sleep peacefully. In the middle of your rest you notice a stabbing pain in your side...and the blood begins to flow.<br><br>It doesn't take you long to realize that they are attacking you.<br><br>You try to defend yourselves.
e_sen25_a_rp2=Oink... I know them... They razed my chapel!
e_sen25_a_rp2_s=Ottis hides behind the group so as not to attract attention, the group leaves and camps elsewhere.<br><br>You rest for a bit.
e_sen25_a_rp3=I'll tell them a story about the Wolf Wars. I hope they don't recognize me
e_sen25_a_rp3_s=Magnus tests the waters and tells them a story, without mentioning which side of the Wolf Wars he fought. Luckily, none of them recognized him.<br><br>They befriend Magnus, share their food with him and tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp3_f=Magnus tests the waters and begins to tell a story.<br><br>Unfortunately he tells them that he fought on the side of the kingdom... That's when the werewolves recognize Magnus and pounce on him.<br><br>Quickly, you join Magnus and the fight continues.
e_sen25_a_rp4=Hello fellow metalheads, this song is just for you!
e_sen25_a_rp4_s=Gustav starts playing a song...and surprisingly they like it.<br><br>They befriend Gustav, and even give him some gold. At the end of the song, they tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>After exchanging songs and stories, you rest for a while.
e_sen25_a_rp4_f=Gustav starts to play a song...and although they don't dislike what they hear...they slowly start to drool thinking about how Gustav will taste.<br><br>Before the song is over, they pounce on him and bite him.<br><br>Quickly, you join Gustav to protect him and the fight continues.
e_sen25_a_rp5=Ohhh marvelous... Willing ears for my stories, let me take a seat.
e_sen25_a_rp5_s=Without missing a moment, Cornelius begins:<br><br>"Was there a time...in a land filled with lava...or was it snow? An evil monster terrified the villagers of a small town..."<br><br>The story continues for so long that everyone in the camp falls asleep.<br><br>You wake up refreshed.
e_sen25_a_rp6=You smell like filthy bandits, and on top of that you are werewolves. You deserve to die!
e_sen25_a_rp6_s=Without a second thought, Bree lunges at one of them and smashes his head with her club. The other werewolves flee in terror.<br><br>After finding a small bag of gold on the dead werewolf, you push him aside and rest for a bit in the camp.
e_sen25_a_rp7=Tell them how you defeated the greater demon, Belphyor.
e_sen25_a_rp7_s=You speak of your battle with the greater demon, Belphyor, showing his horn as evidence.<br><br>They are really impressed with you and tell you their own story, they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the items of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>You rest for a while before continuing.
e_sen25_a_rp8=Show them just the note with the tree and ask about it.
e_sen25_a_rp8_s=You tell them a fake story about why you are looking for that tree.<br><br>They believe you and tell you that the tree is near the southeast fang gate.<br><br>After that you rest for a bit.
e_sen25_a_rp9=Tell them how you helped someone named Raúl.
e_sen25_a_rp9_s=They tell you that Raúl is good friends with them and that his brother has a stall near here.<br><br>They also tell you that they discovered that the dryads have a large stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the items of the dead adventurers who get lost in the forest.<br><br>You rest for a while before continuing.

e_sen25_a_rp10_s=They suddenly jump when they hear your story.<br><br>(Werewolf) "Ohhh... So the little piggy is still alive and in the chapel.<br><br>Great, we won't have to go back to Yogger empty-handed."<br><br>They laugh and attack you.
e_sen27_a_nm=Fresh meat!
e_sen27_a_dsc=As the priest told you, Yogger is here. You can clearly see a big werewolf in the middle of the camp, yelling and giving orders to other werewolves.<br><br>He immediately notices your presence and looks at you with a mocking face.<br><br>Time to honor your promise to the priest and kill him. The butcher of Senenthia has terrorized this forest for far too long.
e_sen27_a_dsca=Running away now would only make things worse.
e_sen27_a_rp0=There isn't much more to say. He dies today.
e_sen27_a_rp0_s=You attack.
e_sen27_a_rp1=You didn't expect him to be that big... Maybe there's a slim chance of escape.
e_sen27_a_rp1_s=You run like never before, after a while you leave the bandit camp behind.<br><br>You hear Yogger stopping the chase and yelling at his men asking them for your head.
e_sen27_a_rp1_f=It was really foolish of you to think you can outrun a pack of werewolves.<br><br>You can do nothing but defend yourselves as best you can.
e_sen27_a_rp1_fc=It was really foolish of you to think you can outrun a pack of werewolves.<br><br>Yogger got a jump on you and strikes first, blood starts to flow.
e_sen27_a_rp2=I know him... He served under me in the Wolf Wars. Maybe I can reason with him.
e_sen27_a_rp2_s=(Yogger) "Well, well, well... If it isn't Captain Magnus in flesh. Do you think your fancy words would change me?<br><br>I see you're still as foolish as ever... You don't seem to remember who gave you that scar. This time I will kill you and take the Wolfslayer with me."<br><br>Fortunately, you had time to prepare for combat while he spoke.
e_sen27_a_rp3=You bastard, I'll cleanse this forest of you and your werewolf gang!
e_sen27_a_rp3_s=(Yogger) "Brave words, for someone so young...<br><br>Now that I think about it... About ten years ago I killed someone like you who said the same words to me. I guess history repeats itself.<br><br>This forest is mine now and always will be!"<br><br>Yogger charges at you. Luckily, Bree was careful and placed the group in an advantageous position for the fight.
e_sen27_a_rp4=Argh! Do you think you can make fun of me? Stupid dog!
e_sen27_a_rp4_s=(Yogger) "And who the hell are you..."<br><br>As Yogger speaks, Grukli lunges at him and delivers a deep cut, leaving him stunned and bleeding.<br><br>The rest of the group joins the fight.
e_sen27_a_rp4_f=(Yogger) "And who the hell are you..."<br><br>As Yogger speaks, Grukli lunges at him, but Yogger dodges and counterattacks, wounding him.<br><br>The rest of the group rushes to fight to cover Grukli.
e_sen27_b_nm=rptd_e_sen27_a_nm
e_sen27_b_dsc=When entering the bandit camp, you see a really big werewolf, yelling and giving orders to other werewolves. He notices your presence and looks at you with a mocking face.<br><br>That's Yogger, the butcher of Senenthia, and he has been terrorizing the Senenthia forest for a long time.<br><br>It's time to put a stop to Yogger and disperse the bandits once and for all.
e_sen27_b_dsca=rptd_e_sen27_a_dsca

e_sen27_b_rp4_f=rptd_e_sen27_a_rp4_f
e_sen27_b_rp5=He really wants to eat me... Oink. Use me as bait...and knock him out first!
e_sen27_b_rp5_s=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... Lucky me."<br><br>The bait is successful, and you hit Yogger in the back of the head while he is distracted by Ottis. The blow isn't hard enough to knock him out, but he looks dazed and weak.
e_sen27_b_rp5_f=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... Lucky me. But don't think I'm so stupid, I know you're up to something so I'm not going to wait... Bon appetit."<br><br>The bait hasn't worked, and Yogger bites Ottis without a second thought. You rush to Ottis's aid, and the fight begins.
e_sen27_c_nm=The butcher's death
e_sen27_c_dsc=You did it! Yogger is no more.<br><br>With the butcher dead, the remaining bandits flee, and the Senenthia Forest will be a little safer.<br><br>Now you can check the camp for gold and other valuable items.
e_sen27_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar6_a1_dsca
e_sen27_c_rp0=Let's see what you find in the camp.
e_sen27_c_rp0_s=Gold and shards were scattered throughout the camp, and you also found a large chest where the bandits kept all the things they looted over time.
e_sen27_c_rp1=The priest will be happy, but first let's see what you find in the camp.
e_sen27_c_rp1_s=Gold and shards were scattered throughout the camp, and you also found a large chest where the bandits kept all the things they looted over time.<br><br>You honored the promise you gave the priest, and now he can leave his chapel and travel the world again.
e_sen30_a_nm=The boy's trail
e_sen30_a_dsc=You arrive at the forest arch that the baker told you about and begin to examine the area.<br><br>You notice a small empty stall near the arch and wonder who in their right mind would make a store here.<br><br>Next to it, you see a group of four trunkies surrounding a hole in the ground that is covered in bushes. You cannot see what is inside it, but you see a trail of something that has entered or left the hole.
e_sen30_a_dsca=Defeat the trunkies to see what's in the hole.
e_sen30_a_rp0=You didn't expect to fight four trunkies at once. Ignore what you said to the baker and go away.
e_sen30_a_rp0_s=You leave, while you imagine that the boy was already dead anyway.
e_sen30_a_rp1=Try to obtain an advantageous position before starting the fight.
e_sen30_a_rp1_s=It was easy to position yourselves in the best possible way to face this fight. You take the initiative and attack them.
e_sen30_a_rp1_sc=It was easy to position yourselves in the best possible way to face this fight. You have even found a way to hide and ambush.
e_sen30_a_rp1_f=When you were positioning, one of you step on a branch that creaks, the trunkies realize that something is happening and stay on guard. The fight begins but you lost the initiative.
e_sen30_a_rp1_fc=As you were positioning yourselves, one of you stumbles over a branch and falls to the ground, leaving the others exposed and quite embarrassed.<br><br>The trunkies notice and take the opportunity to attack you.
e_sen30_a_rp2=Trunkies are basically living trees... With a fire spell, I am sure to disperse them.
e_sen30_a_rp2_s=Evelyn cast a fire spell, and the trunkies caught fire, but so do the bushes covering the hole.<br><br>If the boy is really in the hole, you don't have any time to waste and must fight the trunkies right now.
e_sen30_a_rp2_f=Evelyn casts a spell, but...that wasn't a "fire spell"... What's more, she didn't even manage to reach the trunkies with that spell, how disappointing of her.<br><br>The trunkies get furious after seeing that she tried to burn them and attack you.
e_sen30_a_rp3=I can only see those trunkies as firewood... Let me burn them all!
e_sen30_a_rp3_s=As a fire spellcaster, Cornelius had no trouble reducing the trunkies to ashes with a powerful spell...<br><br>The problem is that he also incinerated the bushes and surely whatever was in the hole.
e_sen30_a_rp3_f=The spell that Cornelius cast wasn't very powerful, for better or worse only the trunkies caught fire. They charge at you, and the fight begins.
e_sen30_a_rp4=Let me take care of this.
e_sen30_a_rp4_s=Bree approaches the Trunkies and in a solemn voice says:<br><br>"I am Bree, protector of this forest, and I command you to stand aside."<br><br>The trunkies obey and scatter, leaving the way to the hole clear.
e_sen30_b_nm=The werewolf stall
e_sen30_b_dsc=You come to a large stone arch in the middle of the forest, and at one side of the arch you see a stall run by a werewolf. When you approach, he says:<br><br>"Hey, hey, finally some customers! Come close and look at my wares. Half of these items come from the bandits. I'm sure there is something interesting you might need.<br><br>Oh...by the way... I didn't kill that boy over there... He was already dead this morning when I came to set up the stall."
e_sen30_b_dsca=This may be a good time to do some shopping.
e_sen30_b_rp0=rptd_e_aquar26_a_rp0
e_sen30_b_rp0_s=Let's see what he has.
e_sen30_b_rp1=Try to get a discount by pointing out the dead boy next to his stall.
e_sen30_b_rp1_s=(Werewolf) "As I said before, I had nothing to do with it...<br><br>Well, I suppose under these circumstances I can offer you a small discount to show my good faith."<br><br>You got a 15% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp1_sc=(Werewolf) "I already explained that I was not the one who killed him, but as it is your first purchase in my store and given the circumstances I offer you my best products, with a good discount."<br><br>You get a 25% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp1_f=The werewolf growls and says:<br><br>(Werewolf) "I won't repeat myself. The boy was dead before I arrived.<br><br>You can look at my wares, but don't expect any discount."
e_sen30_b_rp1_fc=The werewolf growls and says:<br><br>(Werewolf) "How dare you make me say it again... I didn't kill him!<br><br>Now go away before I get angry."<br><br>The werewolf seems to have no intention of selling you anything, so you leave rather disappointed.
e_sen30_b_rp2=Accuse him of killing the boy. You want a big discount or things will get ugly for him.
e_sen30_b_rp2_s=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not afraid of you...and, as you can see, the boy doesn't have any bite marks. I understand that seeing a werewolf alone in the middle of the forest with a corpse of a boy is not very normal...<br><br>I'll give you a good discount, but don't push your luck."<br><br>You got a 30% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_sc=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not in the mood for a fight and you look pretty strong...<br><br>Given the circumstances I'll give you a good discount and show you my best wares."<br><br>You got a 35% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_f=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough, and I'm not going to say it again, so leave me alone and go away before I get angry."<br><br>You leave before a fight breaks out.
e_sen30_b_rp2_fc=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough and it looks like you won't leave me alone... I guess your corpses will be my fault, not like that poor kid."<br><br>The werewolf attacks you.
e_sen30_b_rp3=Let me have a conversation wolf to wolf with him.
e_sen30_b_rp3_s=Magnus approaches the werewolf and talks to him. He empathizes with his situation while taking a quick look at the dead boy.<br><br>After a while the conversation ends and both of them shake hands.<br><br>You got a 25% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp3_f=Magnus approaches the werewolf and starts talking to him. Shortly after you hear a low growl and the conversation stops.<br><br>Magnus was unable to get a discount, but at least you can still browse the goods.
e_sen30_b_rp4=Tell him you met his brother Raúl at the riverside camp.
e_sen30_b_rp4_s=(Werewolf) "Ohh... So it was you who helped my little brother!<br><br>Thank you very much, I will offer you my best products and the biggest discount I can do, my friend."<br><br>You got a 40% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp5=Interesting... Seems like a good candidate for my crew.
e_sen30_b_rp5_s=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf, who is hypnotized, repeats the phrase. You take advantage of it and take everything you need from the store. Before you leave, Nezglekt takes out a small tadpole and inserts it into the werewolf's eye.
e_sen30_b_rp5_f=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf starts to repeat the phrase, but realizes what he is saying and stands there thinking. Before he has time to react you leave the place.
e_sen30_b_rp6=You again? I already told you, I don't want werewolves in my forest!
e_sen30_b_rp6_s=When the werewolf sees Bree, he quickly packs his things and runs off.<br><br>Luckily for you, in his haste he has left a lot of things from the store that could be useful to you.
e_sen30_b_rp7=Hey dude, let me sing you something.
e_sen30_b_rp7_s=(Gustav) "Yeah! in the middle of the forest, come on! We found a very nice werewolf... Croaaakkkk!"<br><br>The werewolf begs you to shut him up and offers you a discount in return.<br><br>You got a 20% discount.
e_sen30_c_nm=The boy in the hole
e_sen30_c_dsc=After dealing with the group of trunkies, you can now freely check out what's inside the hole.
e_sen30_c_dsca=Indeed, the boy is there but...
e_sen30_c_rp0=He is wounded. Luckily you can heal him.
e_sen30_c_rp0_s=You cure the child and give him some supplies so that he can return home safely.<br><br>Before leaving, he tells you that he found a chest in the hole and that's why he was there. He gives you the chest and goes back to his farm.<br><br>You are very satisfied to have fulfilled the baker's request, and you feel very good about it.
e_sen30_c_rp1=He is dead and burned by the fire you caused.
e_sen30_c_rp1_s=The poor kid is burnt to a crisp. You're not sure if he was alive before you burned him... That doesn't change the fact that he's dead.<br><br>Besides the boy, there is a half-burned chest in the hole. Perhaps that is the reason the boy was there. You bury the child and open the chest.<br><br>You told the baker that you would find his son, and you found him... But you are sure that it was not the result he expected when he asked for your help.
e_sen31_a_nm=The moon ritual
e_sen31_a_dsc=You discover a forest glade, and here you can see some menhirs placed in a peculiar way, forming a circle. Inside the circle, there is an altar of some kind, at which an elder dryad performs a strange ritual.<br><br>On the altar are some pieces of gold and a shiny white stone that seems to channel the moonlight.<br><br>The dryad has not yet realized that you are close, but it will surely protect the moonstone at all costs.
e_sen31_a_dsca=You can wait for the ritual to end or interrupt it...
e_sen31_a_rp0=Wait in a safe place for the ritual to end and take what may be left.
e_sen31_a_rp0_s=You wait a bit until the moon begins to set, then you see how the dryad takes the stone and leaves.<br><br>Lucky for you, she left the gold and some items behind.
e_sen31_a_rp1=You're not sure why...but you want that shiny stone, so you attack the dryad.
e_sen31_a_rp1_s=She sees you charging at her and prepares to fight.
e_sen31_a_rp2=You try to distract the dryad and then try steal the shiny stone.
e_sen31_a_rp2_s=You make noise behind a bush and the dryad is confused for a moment. That's when you pick up the shiny stone and run without looking back.<br><br>Surprisingly, the plan worked and you got the moonstone, even though you have no use for it.

Could you teach me a spell to defend myself?"<br><br>The dryad is a bit surprised but seeing that Ottis seems honest she agrees to teach him a spell.<br><br>But then she realizes that the rest of you want to take advantage to steal the shiny stone from her and casts moonfire on poor Ottis, and the fight starts.

e_sen33_a_rp2_s=You have learned from your past experience with the baker's son death.

e_sen33_a_rp3_fc=The dryad spotted you as you moved carelessly through the forest.<br><br>Furious, she casts a starfall spell on you, and you get burned. You can't rest, and your only option is to fight while you're still burning.

e_sen33_a_rp4_f=The dryad has detected you trying to flank her.<br><br>She casts a moonfire spell near you causing some bushes and your clothes to catch fire. You can't stop to put out the fire and you have to fight to defend yourselves.
e_sen33_a_rp4_fc=You take the wrong path and instead of flanking them, you go out into the open right in front of the dryad...<br><br>Furious, she casts a starfall spell on you. You take damage and are burned. There is no choice but to fight with this disadvantage.

e_sen33_a_rp5_s=Bree steps forward staring at the dryad, then at the trunky and finally at Ylmer, saying:<br><br>"Ohh...old friend...

What have you become.<br><br>You two, I relieve you of your guard duty, get out of here."<br><br>The trunky and dryad, tainted by the obelisk, refuse to leave and you quickly join Bree to confront Ylmer.

e_sen35_a_rp3_s=You all distract the jeweler as Thuls gets behind him and steals a small bag of coins.<br><br>After that, you hurry to leave before he realizes that he is missing the coins.
e_sen35_a_rp4=As a fellow craftsman, I demand a 300g discount for the rings.
e_sen35_a_rp4_s=Wilbur and the jeweler start arguing like two grumpy old men. After a while, and just to be left alone, the jeweler accepts the deal and sells you the rings for 300g.

As the farmer told you, there is a group of sheep grazing, and among them you see a larger sheep with golden wool.<br><br>That must be the legendary golden sheep!

e_sen39_a_rp0_s=(Farmer) "As the locals know, the legendary golden sheep is a magical sheep that appears rarely with other grazing sheep and protects them.

e_velka18_b_nm=Express delivery
e_velka18_b_dsc=You arrive at a camp and see another squid-head resting. As you approach, he says:<br><br>"Hello, adventurers. I see you have met my brother. I am Nezglekt, first mate of the Tsnemo's merchant ship, on a mission to reconnoiter these lands and collect interesting objects. I already have a delivery ready, but I am exhausted from the heat.<br><br>I see in your future that you will meet Captain Tsnemo.

e_velka18_b_dsca=Only one of you can carry the package in its accessory slot.
e_velka18_b_rp0=You decide not to help him and get some rest.

e_velka18_b_rp1_s=You take the package and promise to deliver it to Tsnemo when you see him.<br><br>Before you leave you rest a bit. Nezglekt tells you that you will meet him in the void between worlds and gives you some magic shards for your trouble.
e_velka20_a_nm=The fire bazaar
e_velka20_a_dsc=On the side of the mountain, you find a small bazaar that seems to specialize in articles related to fire.<br><br>Taking a first look, you see very interesting articles, but it gives you the feeling that they are going to overcharge you for them.<br><br>You could try to bargain, so that at least the price is right.
e_velka20_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar26_a_dsca
e_velka20_a_rp0=Look at the wares before you leave.

e_velka21_a_nm=The crane
e_velka21_a_dsc=You arrive at a place with a mechanical crane that communicates with somewhere down the mountain.<br><br>This appears to be the way the nearby bazaar and cultists' resupply. The crane is fully loaded and there is a supply ready to go up.<br><br>The problem is that to activate the crane, you have to enter a code using a keypad.
e_velka21_a_dsca=Lifting the cable manually would require a lot of force...
e_velka21_a_rp0=Go away, you don't have time to enter random codes.
e_velka21_a_rp0_s=You leave the site, wondering what could be in the shipment.
e_velka21_a_rp1=Pull the cable with all your might.
e_velka21_a_rp1_s=You have done it! After a long time and now exhausted, you have uploaded the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp1_sc=You made it! After a long time and now exhausted, you have uploaded the shipment.<br><br>It seems that today's shipment is more loaded than usual. You open it and find a lot of gold, items and some obsidians ingots.
e_velka21_a_rp1_f=You do not have enough strength to lift it. Before taking more risks and injuring yourself, you let go of the cable and leave.
e_velka21_a_rp1_fc=You try to pull the cable with all your strength, but the weight is too much for you. You don't let go in time, and you fall down the cliff to a small ledge.<br><br>You have hurt yourselves badly by falling. Now you will slowly climb up the cable to be able to continue your journey.
e_velka21_a_rp2=You know the code, "457" or so said the drunken cultist.
e_velka21_a_rp2_s=The code works and the crane lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp3=Beep... I can hack it.
e_velka21_a_rp3_s=Heiner pulls a cable out of its side and connects to the crane. Shortly after, the crane is activated and lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp4=Let me examine the keypad.
e_velka21_a_rp4_s=Wilbur carefully examines the keypad and deduces that the most worn numbers are the ones that have been used the most.<br><br>On his first attempt, he types in 4 5 7...and eureka! The crane activates and lifts the shipment.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_a_rp5=I will pull up the cargo!
e_velka21_a_rp5_s=Bree grabs the cable with both hands and, with all her strength, pulls the load up.<br><br>You open it and find some gold and items.
e_velka21_b_nm=The obsidian shipment
e_velka21_b_dsc=You arrive at a place with a mechanical crane and see that there is a group of cultists unloading a shipment of supplies and common items.<br><br>When they finish, the cultists begin loading the crane with magic shards and obsidian ingots.<br><br>You assume that this is how the cultists in this area survive, trading supplies for obsidian mined from the volcano.
e_velka21_b_dsca=They haven't finished loading the crane yet, it might be a good time to ambush them and take all the loot.
e_velka21_b_rp0=Ignore them and move on now that they are distracted.
e_velka21_b_rp0_s=The cultists see you... But since they are busy, they prefer to stay out of trouble and let you go.
e_velka21_b_rp1=Hide and attack them by surprise.
e_velka21_b_rp1_s=You hide perfectly and are ready to attack.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_sc=You find the perfect place to hide, and when you attack they won't see you coming. It will be a perfect ambush.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_f=You try to hide, but a little fiend sees you and raises the alarm. You have no choice but to go out in the open and defend yourselves.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you will collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp1_fc=You try to hide. But then a pyromancer sees you, and instead of raising the alarm he approaches the crane and sends the obsidian charge down. Suddenly, he launches a fireball towards your position that hits you.<br><br>At the end of the fight, if you survive, you will take the supplies and shards with you, but you have lost the obsidian cargo.
e_velka21_b_rp2=Argh! I'll push one over the mountain!
e_velka21_b_rp2_s=Grukli charges at a cultist who was on the edge of the mountain and pushes him down the mountain. The other cultists are dazed by what just happened, and you join Grukli to end the fight.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp2_f=Grukli charges at a cultist who was on the edge of the mountain, but the cultist sees him and dodges. It is Grukli who almost fell off the mountain, and although it is not usual for him, he really freaks out for a moment. The cultists prepare to attack him, and you join him to start the fight.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp3=I will mind control one of them...
e_velka21_b_rp3_s=Nezglekt focuses on a Firebrander, as he is the one who seems the dumbest of them, and manages to control him. He then forces him to throw himself down the mountain. The other cultists are surprised by what happened, but they realize that you are there and the fight begins.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka21_b_rp3_f=Nezglekt focuses on a Pyromancer, but it wasn't the best target and he gets rid of the mind control, realizes what Nezglekt was trying to do and throws a fireball that hits him. The fight begins.<br><br>When you finish the fight, you'll collect the magic shards, some supplies and you'll also take a few of those obsidian ingots, as they seem to be quite valuable for forging items.
e_velka22_a_nm=The lava cascade
e_velka22_a_dsc=You are in front of a large lava cascade. If you manage to climb it, you would reach the top of the volcano, but it seems very dangerous.<br><br>In the middle of the cascade, you realize that there is a chest half burned by the flames, but reaching it is also difficult.<br><br>Doing both at the same time seems almost impossible.
e_velka22_a_dsca=rptd_e_secta6_a_dsca
e_velka22_a_rp0=You don't want to end up scorched, you leave.

e_velka22_a_rp1_f=You start to climb, but the terrain is unstable and the heat is becoming more and more intense. Before burning, you prefer to go back down.
e_velka22_a_rp1_fc=You made a wrong step and got burned by the lava... You have no choice but to go back down.
e_velka22_a_rp2=Ignore the chest and try to climb to the top.
e_velka22_a_rp2_s=You reached the top of the volcano.

e_velka22_b_nm=How to boil an egg
e_velka22_b_dsc=You find yourself in front of a large lava cascade, but you can see that climbing it is really dangerous.<br><br>Then you notice that the mosquito egg in your rucksack moves because of the heat, or so you think.<br><br>This could be a good place to try to hatch the egg, but also to cook it. You haven't eaten anything since you left the town and you're getting hungry...
e_velka22_b_dsca=Do you want to cook it or do you want to try to hatch it?
e_velka22_b_rp0=Take out a small pot and boil the egg.
e_velka22_b_rp0_s=You take out a small pot and cook the egg near the lava until it looks edible.<br><br>Although the texture was a bit weird, it was delicious!<br><br>While you were eating it, you were able to study a safe way up the lava cascade.
e_velka22_b_rp1=Place the egg near the lava to hatch.
e_velka22_b_rp1_s=After a while a small mosquito hatches from the egg.<br><br>On its first test flight it hits a small chest in the lava waterfall and the chest falls towards you. The mosquito comes back to you and starts to follow you if you let it.<br><br>You have also seen a safe way up the lava waterfall.
e_velka25_a_nm=The Burning Hand
e_velka25_a_dsc=You enter the cultists' main base, where you meet their high chancellor, Erekhal, along with a few cultists waiting for his order to attack you.<br><br>Erekhal seems willing to see what you want from him.<br><br>You have entered their base and killed many cultists along the way to get here, so there is no chance of leaving without a fight.
e_velka25_a_dsca=What are you going to do?
e_velka25_a_rp0=You don't say anything and you attack him.
e_velka25_a_rp0_s=The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp1=Who are you? I have the real chancellor's staff!
e_velka25_a_rp1_s=(Erekhal) "Ohh, poor Cornelius... Are you so old that you don't even recognize your apprentice?<br><br>You left a long time ago and abandoned us. You have no right to come back!<br><br>Now, I am the high chancellor and leader of the Burning Hand."<br><br>Erekhal gestures to his minions... But they hesitate to face Cornelius and retreat. Still, Erekhal prepares to fight.
e_velka25_a_rp2=We will end you and your cult!
e_velka25_a_rp2_s=Magnus's threatening roar scares a fleeing cultist and the others are left a bit stunned.<br><br>The fight starts.
e_velka25_a_rp2_f=Magnus's words only manage to enrage the cultists rather than scare them.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp3=Sss... I can try to assassinate him.
e_velka25_a_rp3_s=In one swift maneuver, Thuls sneaks up behind Erekhal and stabs him. It's not enough to kill him, but it leaves him quite weakened.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp3_f=One of the cultists detects Thuls and throws a fireball at him. The assassination attempt fails and only enrages the cultists.<br><br>The fight begins.
e_velka25_a_rp4=I remember you... You are the apprentice of that fire mage.
e_velka25_a_rp4_s=(Erekhal) "Your name was Wilbur, right? I'm no longer that naive brat who followed his master around...<br><br>I'm the leader of the Burning Hand! And now I'm much more powerful than him!<br><br>I'll prove it to you..."<br><br>As Erekhal spoke Wilbur made sure to cast a water spell to protect everyone from Erekhal's fire spells.

e_velka25_b_rp1=I promised an old man that I would bring him back that staff you carry
e_velka25_b_rp1_s=(Erekhal) "You, you aren't that child... It can't be...<br><br>So you met the old man... I was hoping he was already dead.<br><br>Never mind. Now I am the leader of the Burning Hand!"<br><br>Erekhal gestures to his minions and prepares to fight.
e_velka25_c_nm=The cult dissolves
e_velka25_c_dsc=With the death of Erekhal, there is no one left to lead the cult of the Burning Hand.<br><br>After your passage through Velkarath decimating their ranks and the death of their leader, the few remaining cultists flee, and the cult is dissolved.

e_velka26_a_nm=Elemental brawl
e_velka26_a_dsc=You arrive at some strange ruins, where three different groups of elementals fight to try to activate and take control of a statue that is in the center.<br><br>They appear to be deadlocked, and none of the groups manages to gain ground from the others.<br><br>Perhaps helping one of them could break the deadlock, and the winner could thank you in some way.
e_velka26_a_dsca=Who do you want to help?
e_velka26_a_rp0=Ignore them.
e_velka26_a_rp0_s=You continue your way to the top of the volcano.
e_velka26_a_rp1=Help the lava elementals.

e_velka26_a2_rp0=The lava elementals activate the statue.

e_velka26_a2_rp1=The stone elementals activate the statue.
e_velka26_a2_rp1_s=The statue breaks and a lot of magic shards appear from it. The stone elementals do not seem to mind that you take all of them.
e_velka26_a2_rp2=The obsidian elementals activate the statue.
e_velka26_a2_rp2_s=The statue is activated but nothing happens. It seems that the statue was already theirs from the beginning.<br><br>One of the elementals drops a chunk of gold at your feet in thanks.
e_velka26_b_nm=The mysterious throne
e_velka26_b_dsc=You arrive at some ancient ruins and, after investigating for a while, you find a room with three glyphs on the floor, a throne at the end of the room and a mural above the throne.<br><br>According to the images on the mural, you believe that a ritual was performed here in which one person sat on the throne while three others were placed on top of each glyph.

e_velka26_b_dsca=Do you want to try to perform the ritual, and if so, who will sit on the throne?
e_velka26_b_rp0=Better not to take the risk and leave.

e_velka7_c_dsca=You say goodbye to the merchant.
e_velka7_c_rp0=You take the gold and the card and leave.

e_velka8_a_dsca=Party time!
e_velka8_a_rp0=Pass discreetly through the banquet and head east.
e_velka8_a_rp0_s=It has not been very difficult not to attract attention.
e_velka8_a_rp0_sc=It was not very difficult not to attract attention. Before leaving you took the opportunity to get some food and recover some health.
e_velka8_a_rp0_f=You don't know how...but you got into a fight with some drunken cultists on your way out.
e_velka8_a_rp0_fc=You don't know how...but you trip and fall in front of some drunks, who laugh at you and start hitting you.
e_velka8_a_rp1=Crash the party! Kill them now while they are drunk.
e_velka8_a_rp1_s=You draw your weapons and attack them.
e_velka8_a_rp2=Let's drink!
e_velka8_a_rp2_s=When you were playing a drinking game, one of the cultists spelled something curious: "457".<br><br>You don't know what those numbers are for...but they seem important.

e_velka9_a1_dsca=It is up to you to go in and face the beast.
e_velka9_a1_rp0=This sounds very dangerous, so you leave.
e_velka9_a1_rp0_s=As you leave, you keep hearing the growls of the furious creature.
e_velka9_a1_rp1=Go in and fight the beast.

e_voidhigh13_a_nm=The moment of truth
e_voidhigh13_a_dsc=You reach the inner sanctum of the obelisk, but it is too late. Any ritual that has been performed here is already over.<br><br>After a quick glance around the room, you can see the body of the princess behind the altar. It seems she is still alive...<br><br>Then your eyes focus on the shadowy figure in front of the altar. It is Lord Hanshek. The brooch on his neck glows brightly and a dark energy emanates from it. He looks at you and gives you a sinister smile.
e_voidhigh13_a_dsca=The moment of truth has come.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0=I served under you in the Wolf Wars to protect the kingdom. Why do you betray it now?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0_s=(Hanshek) "Tough luck, captain. This is beyond you... Although, I suppose I should thank you, since it was you, who helped me recover this gem in the Wolf Wars.<br><br>After extensive research, I discovered that with the gem and the blood of an Architect, I could have a power greater than Queen Amelia herself. Who turned out to be a descendant of the architects.<br><br>Unfortunately, the queen has always been out of my reach, but not the princess...<br><br>Now, at last, that power is mine!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1=Beep... I must protect friends, beep... I must rescue the princess.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1_s=(Hanshek) "Interesting... I never thought I'd see an active war golem again...<br><br>The same power with which the queen created and fueled the golems is mine now. It seems that his power source has been altered and is no longer what it was... So it's of no use to me.<br><br>I'll have to destroy it, along with the rest of you."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2=I can already imagine the feast of fish and beer, grrr... You there, give us back the princess!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2_s=(Hanshek) "So, you're just a simpleton who comes looking for a reward?<br><br>Well then, if you're looking for an early death that's what you'll get.<br><br>Time to test my new powers!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3=You are the one who activated Senenthia's Obelisk, corrupting the forest and my friend Ylmer!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3_s=(Hanshek) "Mmm... Ylmer? You mean that old tree in the Senenthia forest? That poor tree was already in a deep sleep and half dead when I passed by.<br><br>Activating the Obelisks was a necessary means to reach the void and complete my objective. The corruption coming out of them that you saw in the forest will also gradually take over all the realms...<br><br>Rest assured you won't be here to see it!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4=You always struck me as a despicable guy. Looks like I won a bet with my brother
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4_s=(Hanshek) "Well, if it isn't the youngest of the Casthaks, always hiding in the woods and meddling in matters that are none of his business.<br><br>How ironic. You almost foiled my plans in the past... You were lucky that your family's great influence and your brother convinced me... Otherwise, I would have dealt with you by now.<br><br>Well boy, this isn't Senenthia... And it's time to test my new power!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5=Sss... I usually only kill for work... Sss... But this time I'm going to enjoy it.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5_s=(Hanshek) "What an inferior creature... You cannot comprehend the magnitude of what has happened here and the powers I have just gained.<br><br>I would tell you to go back to your swamp... But this is a perfect opportunity to test my new powers."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6=You! You're the one to blame for bringing that thing back, freezing all my people!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6_s=(Hanshek) "What are you talking about? I just activated the obelisk and went on my way.<br><br>You elves, always condescending, arrogant and blaming others... You look like a young elf who just came out of the forest and knows nothing about the world.<br><br>Listen young lady, this place and this magic I just obtained predates the elves and is much more powerful. It's a shame... But you won't be able to go back to your forest."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7=So you're the bad guy in my epic tale? This battle will be legendary. It's showtime!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7_s=(Hanshek) "And what are you supposed to be, a singing frog? What a joke.<br><br>I don't have time for this nonsense... But your companions seem to be a threat, so I'll have to finish you off with my new powers."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8=We grew up together. You were like a big brother... Why did you kidnap the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8_s=(Hanshek) "Evelyn, you should know better than anyone... Queen Amelia's great magic power was not normal.<br><br>I always wanted that power for myself and after long years of study and this gem, I discovered that the queen was a descendant of the architects and magic ran through her ancient blood.<br><br>The queen was never within my reach, but a few days ago, on her anniversary, the princess awakened that same power. So I took the opportunity to bring her to this ancient place and with a ritual, take away her power."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9=Seeking power at all costs will do you no good... But fear not, my flames will consume your darkness.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9_s=(Hanshek) "Hypocritical words coming from the summoner of demons and founder of the Burning Hand...<br><br>You may have had a lot of power in your prime that could've easily taken me down, but now you're just a decrepit old man, and your flames are no longer a threat.<br><br>Prepare to succumb to a power greater than you've ever had!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10=What an interesting place, can you explain what ritual you did to document it?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10_s=(Hanshek) "I never expected to meet a gnome here of all places... And that flying machine also caught my eye. Maybe I'll keep it when I'm done with you.<br><br>As for the ritual, it's all thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, a direct descendant of the architects... But someone who is about to die doesn't need to know anything else."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11=Interesting dark magic you've obtained... But you're a fool and you'll find out soon enough
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11_s=(Hanshek) "You're just a rat. How can you presuppose that your knowledge of dark magic is greater than mine?<br><br>I will show you the great dark power I have obtained and how insignificant you are in comparison."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12=I thought we were friends, I respected you... What have you done to the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12_s=(Hanshek) "Reginald, I have always held you in high esteem. You were one of the few I could have a normal conversation with in Senenthia.<br><br>But ever since I saw the queen's great powers, I wanted that power for myself. Now, thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, that power is mine.<br><br>The princess is only unconscious, but I'm afraid now I have to finish you off old friend..."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13=Oink... I can feel that gem you're wearing is bad news... You should get rid of it.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13_s=(Hanshek) "You ignorant swine! This gem is the source of my new power, and neither you nor anyone else will separate me from it.<br><br>I will show you that I am the only one who can bring out its full potential and I will finish you."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14=It's too late for you... You're cursed and being controlled by that gem.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14_s=(Hanshek) "Speak for yourself... What can a swamp witch like you know about curses when she doesn't see the truth about herself?<br><br>This gem is the source of a power you cannot comprehend, but rest assured I will now show you what it is capable of."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15=After seeing the destruction that power has caused to this place... You foolish human...
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15_s=(Hanshek) "Don't try to get into my mind, squid! It is futile. I know what you are.<br><br>A race that travels worlds and planes at ease, only to steal the relics from their inhabitants to sell elsewhere is no less foolish.<br><br>I will show you what we are capable of!"

e_voidhigh6_a_nm=The colored runes
e_voidhigh6_a_dsc=You arrive at some strange circular ruins. In the center, you can see a magic circle and around it you see twelve plates.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp3_s=When you go to press the last rune, you realize that the purple gem is missing, Tsnemo forgot to tell you this small detail...<br><br>To try your luck, you press the rune next to it to see what happens.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp4=Place the purple gem in the runic slot and press yellow, green and purple.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp4_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a strange energy emanates from it.<br><br>As Tsnemo told you, you place yourself in the center and take the opportunity to meditate.<br><br>When you finish the meditation, you feel relaxed and with more energy to start the next fight. (Initial energy +1)
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5=As the demon summoning guide says, you press black, orange and red.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a demon from hell is summoned.<br><br>The demon does not seem hostile. It approaches you and offers you an ancient artifact of incredible quality.<br><br>Furthermore, he bows to you and offers to serve you if you accept him.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp6=As the innkeeper at the Happy Owl told you, you press green, yellow and blue.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp6_s=When the last rune is pressed, the magic circle lights up and a large number of supply boxes appear.<br><br>The story of the Happy Owl innkeeper's grandfather was true.

e_voidlow14_a_nm=The sacred forge
e_voidlow14_a_dsc=You encounter a white construct hitting an anvil with a hammer, and next to it you can see an inactive Oddball. As you approach it, it says to you:<br><br>"Fear not, I am a blacksmith who loves working with platinum. Right now, I was trying to fix this Oddball, but I lack another type of metal to fix its damaged dark side.<br><br>I'm also very good at forging magical items, like this platinum ring that you can keep, but if you give me some kind of rare material, I'll make you something even more impressive."
e_voidlow14_a_dsca=Do you have something he can use to forge an item?
e_voidlow14_a_rp0=You take the ring and thank him.
e_voidlow14_a_rp0_s=As you have nothing to give him, you take the ring and thank him before leaving.
e_voidlow14_a_rp1=You offer him the large emerald.
e_voidlow14_a_rp1_s=He takes the emerald and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic staff and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp2=You offer him the huge ruby.
e_voidlow14_a_rp2_s=He takes the ruby and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic armor and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp3=You offer him the magic sapphire.
e_voidlow14_a_rp3_s=He takes the sapphire and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic amulet and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp4=You offer him the golden wool.
e_voidlow14_a_rp4_s=He takes the wool and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic cloak and the platinum ring.<br><br>You thank him before you leave.
e_voidlow14_a_rp5=You offer him the obsidian ingots.
e_voidlow14_a_rp5_s=He takes the obsidian and starts forging a magic item. After a while, he gives you a finished magic dagger and the platinum ring.<br><br>With the leftover obsidian he forges a strange component that fits into the broken Oddball.<br><br>When activated, the Oddball seems harmless and starts to follow you. The construct says goodbye and lets you keep the Oddball.

e_voidlow15_a_dsc=You arrive at a place that already has some tents set up and seems uninhabited.<br><br>In the distance, you can see a large tower with stairs.

e_voidlow16_a_dsc=You arrive at some ruins with huge columns still standing.

The chest is locked and sealed with magic. It seems impossible to open unless you have the key.
e_voidlow16_a_dsca=So unless you have the key, you settle for the rest of the treasure.
e_voidlow16_a_rp0=You search in the treasure and take as much as you can.
e_voidlow16_a_rp0_s=In the treasure, you find many unique items that can be useful to you. You also collect as much gold as you can carry.
e_voidlow16_a_rp1=You use the key to open the jade chest.
e_voidlow16_a_rp1_s=Inside, you find only an old straw hat and a note that reads:<br><br>"The greatest treasure of all is the friends you've made along the way.<br><br>-- Nook, the treasure hunter."<br><br>After being stunned for a moment, you burst out laughing and decide to pick up the rest of the treasure.

e_voidlow21_a_rp0_s=The book tells how the ancient race known as the architects rebelled against their rulers, the three archons.<br><br>It is written that, after centuries of ruling, the archons became corrupt and created powerful artifacts capable of destroying worlds.

e_voidlow21_a_rp1=Take some scrolls of intellect.
e_voidlow21_a_rp1_s=You decide to search through all the books and scrolls, and take a scroll of intellect for each of you.<br><br>Then, you leave the library.

e_voidlow21_a_rp2_s=You decide to search through all the books and scrolls, and take a scroll of defense for each of you.<br><br>Then, you leave the library.

e_voidlow21_a_rp5_s=You've never seen Wilbur so excited... He keeps moving from one place to another, searching through the piles of books and dust.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, it's time to go, so you force Wilbur to keep just one book for the road and leave.
e_voidlow21_a_rp6=Look what I found hidden! Now it's mine.

e_voidlow21_a_rp7_s=It's incredible, you have found it, an intact copy! You know the first two colors, black and orange, so you read on to discover the third.<br><br>"The third color of hell is red.

e_voidlow24_a_rp0=You don't want to give him gold.
e_voidlow24_a_rp0_s=You tell him that you are not interested, that you have no gold to spare and you walk away from the ship.
e_voidlow24_a_rp1=Give him 400g.
e_voidlow24_a_rp1_s=Tsnemo tells you that these are the ruins of an ancient civilization known as the architects and that, after a great war against their rulers, their kingdom was destroyed.<br><br>He also tells you that if you want to go to the upper ruins, you will have to face two colossal automatons and that you had better protect yourselves against holy damage.
e_voidlow24_a_rp2=Give him 800g.
e_voidlow24_a_rp2_s=Tsnemo tells you that if you want to go to the upper ruins, you will have to face two colossal automatons and that you had better protect yourselves against holy damage.<br><br>He also tells you that there is a place that is perfect for meditation in the upper ruins.

e_voidlow24_a_rp3=Give him 1,200g.

e_voidlow25_a_nm=The twins
e_voidlow25_a_dsc=You are at the base of the great staircase, but in front of you there are two colossal automatons blocking your way.<br><br>The automatons do not attack you immediately.

e_voidlow25_a_rp0=You attack them directly.
e_voidlow25_a_rp0_s=As you approach, they stand on guard and the fight begins.
e_voidlow25_a_rp1=You try to rest and recover your strength.
e_voidlow25_a_rp1_s=While you are resting, you see how the automatons reinforce themselves and increase their defenses.<br><br>Before it is too late and without wasting any more time, you decide to attack them.
e_voidlow25_a_rp2=As Tsnemo told you, you make sure to prepare your holy defenses.
e_voidlow25_a_rp2_s=Before the combat starts, you make sure to cast a spell of protection against holy damage and rest for a while.
e_voidlow25_b_nm=The twins fall
e_voidlow25_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you have defeated the two colossal automatons and the way to the stairs is clear.<br><br>Before you start the ascent, you notice that there is a large ancient chest on one side of the tower.

e_voidlow26_a_dsc=In front of you, there is a staircase that reaches as far as the eye can see.

e_voidlow5_a_nm=The two armies
e_voidlow5_a_dsc=You arrive at some ruins where it seems that many battles have been fought. There are only two paths to move forward, and each one is protected by an army of constructs.<br><br>To the north is the white army and to the south is the black army.
e_voidlow5_a_dsca=If you want to advance you must decide which army to fight.
e_voidlow5_a_rp0=Go north and fight the white constructs.

e_voidlow5_a_rp1=Go south and fight the black constructs.
e_voidlow5_a_rp1_s=You decide to face the black army. The fight begins.
e_voidlow6_a_nm=The white statue
e_voidlow6_a_dsc=After defeating the constructs, you find a large white statue. When you examine it, you see that it has a keyhole in the center.<br><br>The magic bridge that connects the ruins seems to be weakened. You imagine that somehow the statue serves to reactivate it and access the central ruins, otherwise it would be impossible to get there.<br><br>Luckily, there is another path that would allow you to move forward, but it leads you away from the central ruins.
e_voidlow6_a_dsca=The only way to continue to the center is to have the key or somehow pick the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0=You are leaving, since you don't have the key.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0_s=As there is nothing you can do, you take the other path.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1=You use the white key in the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1_s=The key works perfectly and you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2=You try to pick the lock somehow.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_s=Incredibly, after tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_sc=Incredibly, after tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click. Then you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.<br><br>In addition, you have opened a secret compartment of the statue in which you have found quite a few magic shards.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_f=After tinkering with the lock for a while, nothing useful happens and you have no choice but to leave rather disappointed.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_fc=After tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click...but something is wrong... Suddenly, the statue discharges a strong electric current that electrocutes you.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3=Sss... I can try to pick the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_s=Thuls pulls out a lock pick and manages to pick the lock. You see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_f=Thuls pulls out a lock pick, but fails to pick the lock. Thuls feels a bit humiliated and you have no choice but to leave.
e_voidlow6_a_rp4=Well, just this once... You can get on.
e_voidlow6_a_rp4_s=If you decide to go to the other side, Willbur allows you to get on his flying platform and, one by one, he takes you to the central ruins.

e_challengelow_13_nm=Tavern in the mist
e_challengelow_13_dsc=A very thick fog rises in front of you. As you move forward, a tavern appears out of nowhere.<br><br>You decide to enter, and then you see the tavern keeper who says to you:<br><br>"Welcome, it's good to see new faces! What brings you here? Do you want a drink? If you want I can also sell you some personalized cups along with your drinks."
e_challengelow_13_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_challengelow_13_rp0=You rest for a moment and leave.
e_challengelow_13_rp0_s=You sit down for a moment and politely tell the tavern keeper that you don't want anything.<br><br>You leave before abusing the hospitality.
e_challengelow_13_rp1=You buy some drinks for 200g.
e_challengelow_13_rp1_s=The drinks are very refreshing, and you recover your strength.<br><br>Then the tavern keeper shows you his wide range of cups.
e_challengelow_13_rp2=You buy the highest quality drinks for 1,000g.
e_challengelow_13_rp2_s=The tavern keeper brings you his best drinks. They are very tasty, and besides recovering your strength you are also very satisfied.<br><br>As the tavern keeper is happy for the great expense you have made, he sells you his cups at a 50% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3=You are only interested in the cups and would like a discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_s=The tavern keeper has taken a liking to you and although you don't want drinks, he agrees to sell you his cups at a discount.<br><br>You get a 15% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_sc=The tavern keeper liked you very much and although you don't want drinks, he accepts to sell you his cups at a good discount.<br><br>You get a 30% discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_f=The bartender is somewhat disappointed that you don't want drinks, yet he agrees to sell you his cups without discount.
e_challengelow_13_rp3_fc=Unwittingly, you have managed to anger the tavern keeper. He offers you nothing and throws you out of the tavern.<br><br>You leave rather disappointed.
e_sen21_c_nm=The pigmen congregation
e_sen21_c_dsc=You arrive at a chapel near the river.<br><br>The door is ajar and as you peek inside you see a group of pigmen attending some sort of mass.<br><br>You are struck by the fact that the pigman who is officiating the mass is dressed in a pope's costume.
e_sen21_c_dsca=rptd_e_aquar13_a_dsca
e_sen21_c_rp0=You don't want to bother them and you leave.
e_sen21_c_rp0_s=rptd_e_sen21_a_rp0_s
e_sen21_c_rp1=You enter to attend the mass.
e_sen21_c_rp1_s=You enter trying not to attract too much attention, but when Yogger enters the door the pigmen panic.<br><br>Chaos takes over the church and all the pigmen stumble out wherever they can.<br><br>In a moment, the church is empty... So you take the opportunity to grab some of the objects left behind by the pigmen.
e_sen21_c_rp2=Boo! I finally found you, piggy!
e_sen21_c_rp2_s=When the pigmen see Yogger, they panic.<br><br>While Yogger is laughing loudly, the little pig dressed as a pope disappears in the crowd of pigmen who are trying to run away stumbling out of the chapel.<br><br>In a moment, the church is empty... So you take the opportunity to grab some of the objects left behind by the pigmen.
e_sen25_a_rp11=How are you guys doing? Any news to report?
e_sen25_a_rp11_s=When the werewolves see Yogger in the group, they immediately make a place for him in the camp and share their food with him. Then they tell him that they discovered that the dryads have a big stash in -Forest Deeps- where they keep all the objects of the dead adventurers that are lost in the forest.<br><br>Before leaving, they give you some gold that they have stolen from some peasants who were crossing the forest.
e_sen27_d_nm=The boss is back!
e_sen27_d_dsc=You arrive at a bandit camp where you see a group of werewolves looking at you threateningly.<br><br>Luckily, they realize that you are with Yogger and in a moment the atmosphere calms down.
e_sen27_d_dsca=They welcome you to the camp and you take the opportunity to rest a little.
e_sen27_d_rp0=While I'm here, I'll pick up my things
e_sen27_d_rp0_s=Yogger enters one of the camp tents and shortly after comes out with his cleaver and a few other items.<br><br>After resting for a while, you leave the camp.
e_sen27_d_rp1=Once again together... and once again I wonder... what are you fighting for?
e_sen27_d_rp1_s=(Yogger) "The truth is that I have been bored in this forest for some time. A messenger from the king found me and offered me amnesty and a good reward if I returned his daughter safely.<br><br>So here I am, but make no mistake Captain... this time we are equal, and nobody gives me orders!<br><br>While we're at it... let me show you something I've learned over the years. I'll also take the opportunity to pick up some of my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp2=Beep... I was here a few years ago...  Damaged memory... Beep
e_sen27_d_rp2_s=(Yogger) "This old piece of metal brings back memories... I was able to play with a model that looked like yours, it was a good killing machine!<br><br>Maybe I can teach you a little trick... Besides, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp3=So, you're like a chef? Do you know how to prepare fish?
e_sen27_d_rp3_s=(Yogger) "I'm more specialized in meat...<br><br>Since we have some free time, I'm going to teach you how to cut meat the best way.<br><br>Besides, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp4=How the hell did I end up teaming up with the likes of you!
e_sen27_d_rp4_s=(Yogger) "You know it well little doe... you were one short of being an official search party and I was your only option.<br><br>But don't worry... the king has offered me amnesty and a good reward if I return his daughter safely. So for now, let's get along...<br><br>While we're at it, I'm going to show you a little trick of mine and take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen27_d_rp5=Oink... I don't feel very safe and comfortable...
e_sen27_d_rp5_s=(Yogger) "Don't worry little piggy, as long as you're with me my werewolves won't touch you.<br><br>As for me... if you dare to defect from my group a second time, like you did years ago... Then I will turn you into mincemeat on the spot, and this time there will be no stopping me!<br><br>While we're here, I'll take the opportunity to pick up my stuff."
e_sen30_b_rp8=You don't expect me to pay for my own stuff... do you?
e_sen30_b_rp8_s=When the merchant sees Yogger, he becomes quite frightened. But he gradually pulls himself together and argues that not all of his merchandise is from the bandit camp... and besides, he paid them for it.<br><br>Even so, and clearly still quite frightened, he offers you a 50% discount.<br><br>You accept the discount and look at his merchandise.
e_sen33_a_rp6=I should have cut down this tree a long time ago! Now no one will stop me!
e_sen33_a_rp6_s=Yogger draws his weapon and charges at the old treant with a loud war howl.<br><br>The rest of you are motivated by the howl and follow him into battle.
e_sen45_a_nm=Yogger's diary
e_sen45_a_dsc=You explore the forest behind the camp and near a tree you find an old diary.<br><br>After a quick glance you realize that it is Yogger's diary.<br><br>The diary talks about when Yogger was young and everything that happened to him in the Wolf Wars.
e_sen45_a_dsca=Do you want to read the diary?
e_sen45_a_rp0=Read Yogger's diary.
e_sen45_a_rp0_s=(Yogger) "The war is about to begin and it is time for me to choose a side.<br><br>The werewolf side is divided... There are many who prefer to annex the kingdom and will fight for it.<br><br>Although I pretty much agree with old Chieftain Gorio... I think I can get more out of it by joining the kingdom and seeing what happens."
e_sen45_a_rp1=You don't want to read the diary.
e_sen45_a_rp1_s=You leave the diary where it was and continue on your way.
e_sen46_a_nm=The wolf cub
e_sen46_a_dsc=When you leave the bandit camp, you stop for a while to rest and assimilate everything you have read in Yogger's diary.<br><br>Thanks to it, you have discovered what happened in the Wolf Wars from the point of view of one of the most relevant characters of the war.<br><br>While you are resting, a small wolf cub appears from the nearby forest.
e_sen46_a_dsca=The wolf cub approaches you without fear and seems to have taken a liking to you.
e_sen46_a_rp0=You decided to adopt the wolf cub.
e_sen46_a_rp0_s=The wolf cub seems to be very happy that you let him go with you.<br><br>You call him Wolfy.
e_sen46_a_rp1=You don't want to take care of the wolf cub.
e_sen46_a_rp1_s=You abandon the wolf cub near the forest and continue on your way.

e_aquar8_a_rp10=You do not know who I am? Don't make me go find your boss...
e_aquar8_a_rp10_s=One of the crocomen recognizes Yogger and knows that he is friends with his boss, Irwin.<br><br>Before things get complicated the crocomen give you a boat for free. Now you can sail through the marsh.
e_aquar30_b_rp5=rptd_e_aquar30_b_rp2
e_aquar30_b_rp5_s=Grukli offers to go with Yogger... You don't really know what's going on inside, but after a while, Yogger comes out retching and annoyed.<br><br>Then Grukli comes out, blushing and with no choice but to admit that he had to live in that cave for a while... At least he brings with him some gold and magic shards.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp16=When we met at that dig, I could tell you were up to no good...
e_voidhigh13_a_rp16_s=(Hanshek) "Ohh! So the local bandit has come all the way to the end of the world... and for what?<br><br>Although I suppose I should thank you... It's thanks to you that I recovered this gem in the Wolf Wars. Besides, when the Chieftain fell you did me another favor by rebelling and taking the rest of the werewolves with you. Thanks to that, no one noticed the excavation, and I had some time to study the gem without the Queen meddling.<br><br>As a reward, I will give you a quick death!"
e_forge3_a_nm=The outer forge
e_forge3_a_dsc=On the wall of the volcano you find a dwarven forge for auxiliary works of the city. Although it is somewhat damaged, it seems to still work.<br><br>On one side of the forge, you see some obsidian ingots and some dwarf blueprints that are still intact.<br><br>Obsidian ingots are valuable in their own right, but perhaps you could try using them to craft some of the dwarven items shown on the blueprints.

e_forge4_a_nm=The flooded mine
e_forge4_a_dsc=You find the entrance to a mine that is partially flooded with lava.<br><br>At the entrance of the main tunnel, you can see that there is a large emerald in a small compartment. Also along the tunnel, you see a large amount of gold and shards.<br><br>You can go in to retrieve the emerald, as well as some gold and shards. The further you decide to go in, the more gold and shards you will have the chance to pick up, but it will be more dangerous.
e_forge4_a_dsca=How far do you want to go?
e_forge4_a_rp0=You don't want to go into the tunnel and get burned.
e_forge4_a_rp0_s=You do not waste more time and move forward.
e_forge4_a_rp1=You enter a short distance that seems safe.
e_forge4_a_rp1_s=The first thing you do when you enter the tunnel is to pick up the large emerald. Then you try to get as much gold and shards as you can without getting hurt by lava.

e_forge5_a_nm=The destroyed workshop
e_forge5_a_dsc=You arrive at a small workshop with two large ash-covered statues. The place is wrecked, full of broken dwarven machines and pieces of metal.<br><br>You search through the rubble for anything of value and find a locked box, decorated with dwarven motifs that look quite ancient.<br><br>The box does not seem exceptionally difficult to open, and you could open it with a little effort.
e_forge5_a_dsca=Do you want to try to open the box?
e_forge5_a_rp0=You decide to leave the box unopened and move on.
e_forge5_a_rp0_s=You leave the box behind and walk away.<br><br>When you pass near the statues, they activate. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp1=You decide to open the box.
e_forge5_a_rp1_s=Inside the box, you find a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>Unfortunately, when opening the box, several small machines have been activated, in addition to the two large statues. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp2=Beep... let me analyze these statues first
e_forge5_a_rp2_s=Heiner begins to analyze the statues and sees a way to improve his lasers, then realizes that they are not statues, but dwarven golems.<br><br>At the same time, one of you impatiently opens the box and finds a small mysterious key with a black ribbon. Unfortunately, opening the box activates the golems and several machines around you.<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge5_a_rp3=Sss... let me open it!
e_forge5_a_rp3_s=Thuls opens the box carefully and realizes that there was some kind of trap set, but luckily he is skillful enough not to set it off. Inside the box, you find a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>When you pass near the statues, they activate. You suddenly realize that they weren't statues, but inactive dwarven golems covered in ash!<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge6_a_nm=The Dwarven terminator
e_forge6_a_dsc=You see a large hole in the wall of the volcano that seems to be connected to the inner city. As you get closer, you hear an increasingly loud noise of chains and metal.<br><br>Suddenly, the chains pull a large dwarven war machine out of the hole. The machine is quite broken, but somehow its core is still active and the machine is still running.<br><br>It is clear that the war machine is hostile and that destroying it completely is the only way forward and out of the volcano.
e_forge6_a_dsca=You have to decide quickly how to deal with it.
e_forge6_a_rp0=You attack it quickly without wasting any more time.
e_forge6_a_rp0_s=Without thinking twice, you attack the dwarven war machine immediately.
e_forge6_a_rp1=Try to hide behind some rubble and rest before fighting.
e_forge6_a_rp1_s=You manage to hide and rest a bit without being detected. However, it seems that now the dwarven machine has a little more armor.
e_forge6_a_rp1_sc=You manage to hide and get some rest without being detected. You have been able to rest perfectly and it seems that there is no change in the dwarven machine.
e_forge6_a_rp1_f=You manage to hide, but when you start to rest the dwarven machine detects you. It also seems that now the dwarven machine has a little more armor.
e_forge6_a_rp1_fc=You have miserably failed to hide and the dwarven war machine launches a wave of missiles at you, which will damage you and cause severe burns.
e_forge6_a_rp2=It can't be... That thing exploded! I sacrificed so much...
e_forge6_a_rp2_s=For the first time in your adventure, you see the old wizard shudder as if he had seen a ghost. Instinctively, he takes a few steps back and casts a spell to protect the group from the fire.<br><br>Cornelius pulls himself together and the fight begins.
e_forge6_a_rp3=I'm pretty sure we destroyed that thing... This is going to be tough
e_forge6_a_rp3_s=Wilbur frowns in disbelief and tells the group that he has faced this machine before.<br><br>He then casts a water spell that soaks your clothes and prepares you for what is to come.
e_forge6_a_rp4=Beep... Danger! Danger!
e_forge6_a_rp4_s=Heiner's core begins to resonate with that of the war machine, and he can sense the impending danger!<br><br>Heiner somehow manages to reduce the machine's armor a bit and takes the opportunity to increase the group's armor before combat begins.

e_forge6_c_dsc=After a hard fight you defeat the dwarven war machine and several of its parts fall into the lava.<br><br>Luckily the cockpit and the core remain hanging from one of the chains.
e_forge6_c_dsca=Carefully you climb up to see what you can find of value.
e_forge6_c_rp0=You loot the dwarven machine.
e_forge6_c_rp0_s=Inside the cockpit, you find some gold and various valuables.<br><br>When you finish looting the remains of the dwarven machine, you break the remaining chain that holds it.<br><br>The machine falls and melts into the lava forever.
e_forge6_c_rp1=You make sure to extract the core and loot the cockpit.
e_forge6_c_rp1_s=Surprisingly the core still works. With it, you will be able to repair the golem you found in Senenthia's tower.

e_forge7_a_nm=Fresh Air

e_forge7_a_rp0_s=You continue your way to the top of the volcano.
e_forge8_a_nm=The lava fisherman
e_forge8_a_dsc=You find an old dwarf sitting on a pile of rubble on the lava. As you approach he greets you:<br><br>"Hey youngsters, you wouldn't happen to be amateur fishermen by any chance? You see, when I was young and the Forge was active, I used to come fishing in the lava of the volcano with some friends... With a little trick of ours and a steel rod, we learned to fish even lava blobs!<br><br>But now there is only me left... I often come to sit here near the lava to remember them.
e_forge8_a_dsca=So, do you like fishing or not?"
e_forge8_a_rp0=You have no time to waste talking.
e_forge8_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to the dwarf and continue on your way.
e_forge8_a_rp1=Yes! We even fished in the frozen sea of Faeborg!
e_forge8_a_rp1_s=Passionately you answer yes, and the dwarf believes you without a moment's hesitation. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left. Take these fish as a gift, although I'm a good fisherman I'm not a very good cook and the lava burned them...  Hahahahaha..."<br><br>After giving you the fish, he continues laughing and you say goodbye.
e_forge8_a_rp2=Yes! We've managed to fish in some frozen sewers!
e_forge8_a_rp2_s=rptd_e_forge8_a_rp1_s
e_forge8_a_rp3=Of course! This is our last catch.
e_forge8_a_rp3_s=The dwarf is amazed when you show him the big fish. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left. Take these fish as a gift, although I'm a good fisherman I'm not a very good cook and the lava burned them...  Hahahahaha..."<br><br>After giving you the fish, he continues laughing and you say goodbye.
e_forge8_a_rp4=Fishing runs through my veins! I love it!
e_forge8_a_rp4_s=When the dwarf sees Grukli, his expression turns tender and he says:<br><br>"Ohh! A young dwarf fisherman! Besides that, you remind me a lot of a friend of mine... His name was Thorim and we used to go fishing often at the end of the shift.<br><br>I still have his old rod with me... You know what... Keep it! I'm sure you'll get more out of it than me."<br><br>You thank him and leave.
e_forge8_a_rp5=Yes! I always carry my rod with me!
e_forge8_a_rp5_s=The dwarf sees your fishing rod and is pleased. He says to you:<br><br>"I see you are one of mine! It is good that there are still young fishermen left.

e_forge8_a_rp9=Yes! Would you get me a lava blob with this rod?
e_forge8_a_rp9_s=The dwarf rejoices when he sees that you are carrying that rod with you. He says to you:<br><br>"Ohh! A fellow fisherman! It's been a while since I last tried, but don't worry, this is never forgotten!"<br><br>The dwarf uses your steel rod and when the hook touches the lava he gives it a couple of quick twists and pulls hard. A lava blob pops out of the lava and begins to follow you.<br><br>The dwarf returns the rod, you thank him and leave.

e_forge9_a_dsc=In front of you is the main entrance to the dwarven city, sealed off after the events of the Obsidian Uprising.<br><br>You would have liked to see this engineering marvel that the dwarves excavated inside the volcano, but you see no way to enter.<br><br>However, among the stones you see an old dwarven journal.
e_forge9_a_dsca=The journal is partially burned and almost impossible to read.
e_forge9_a_rp0=You try to read the dwarven journal.
e_forge9_a_rp0_s=Unfortunately, it's too burned, and you can only read a few loose fragments like "Counselor Amelia's visit" or "The fire wizard gathered his followers".<br><br>You deduce that the diary narrates the beginning of the Obsidian Uprising, but you can't get anything else clear.<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp1=You ignore the journal and continue on your way.

And the little girl, what happened to her? I cannot remember..."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp3=This was a magnificent city...
e_forge9_a_rp3_s=(Wilbur) "I remember visiting the city when I was younger. I spent a lot of time studying the strange mechanisms of the dwarves, until the uprising broke out...<br><br>A pity. The city was a real engineering feat... not as cool as my current workshop, of course."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp4=My mother used to tell me stories about this city
e_forge9_a_rp4_s=(Grukli) "She told me that she used to come to the city and there she fell in love with a brave dwarf... Unfortunately, she lost track of him when the uprising started and never heard from him again.<br><br>Arghhh... I miss her..."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_forge9_a_rp5=It's a pity I didn't come a few years ago...
e_forge9_a_rp5_s=(Nezglekt) "This city looks like it used to be the perfect place to trade artifacts.<br><br>I wonder if Captain Tsnemo or any of the crew would know of a way to get in and retrieve some of them... Although I don't think any of mine could stand the heat inside."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_sewers10_a_nm=The advisor's story
e_sewers10_a_dsc=You arrive at a palisade and find a couple of ratmen standing by some magical torches. One of them says:<br><br>"Interesting... If you are here, it means you have entered through the crack and defeated the dead.<br><br>You see, I was one of the king's advisors... One of his rings saved him from freezing and then he managed to unfreeze some of us. But soon after, he made a deal with a dracomancer named Fred, and betrayed us all...
e_sewers10_a_dsca=Well, that doesn't matter anymore. Thanks to you, we can go out. Can I do something for you?
e_sewers10_a_rp0=Could you give us one of those torches?
e_sewers10_a_rp0_s=(Ratman) "Of course, after all thanks to you, the way out is clear and we can leave.<br><br>Take one, thanks to them we have survived the intense cold. I hope they help you."<br><br>The ratman gives you the torch and then you leave.
e_sewers10_a_rp1=What was the deal the king made?
e_sewers10_a_rp1_s=(Ratman) "Fred, offered the king a lot of elven jewelry, as well as a scepter to control the dead. In exchange, the dracomancers would be free to move through the sewers and reanimate our people.<br><br>The king had become very sadistic since he learned dark magic. He liked to make dark deals with his own people...<br><br>A word of advice, if the king offers you a deal. Know that he doesn't need to extract your vitality to complete his corruption magic."
e_sewers10_a_rp2=Remember me? What happened after you exiled me?
e_sewers10_a_rp2_s=(Ratman) "Yes, I remember you... A few years after exiling you, the king became greedy and fearless of the elves. He decided to open the vault in search of power and magic items. Together with him, some of his advisors got hold of several ancient books and learned dark magic. After practicing in secret for several years, we were ready to attack the elves above when the frost surprised us.<br><br>A word of advice, I doubt you'll make a deal with him... but just in case. Know that he doesn't need to extract your vitality to complete his corruption magic.<br><br>Before you go, I apologize for exiling you. Here, take one of these magic torches, I'm sure it will come in handy."
e_sewers11_a_nm=The starving ratman
e_sewers11_a_dsc=In a corner you find a rat man looking through some crates, when he sees you, he says:<br><br>"Huh... ho... don't hurt me! I'm alive! I'm alive! Or at least for the moment... <br><br>I had to take a chance and get out of the palisade... We've run out of food and we're not going to last long. But there's nothing left here, I only found an old mysterious key and little else.
e_sewers11_a_dsca=Don't you have some food for me?"
e_sewers11_a_rp0=You share some of your normal rations.
e_sewers11_a_rp0_s=You give him some of your food and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead.<br><br>The ratman is very happy and thanks you. Before saying goodbye, he gives you the old mysterious key he found in the crates.<br><br>You also search through the crates, but as the ratman said, you find nothing of value.
e_sewers11_a_rp1=You can have this fish.
e_sewers11_a_rp1_s=You give him the fish and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Thank you so much! You see, I haven't been entirely honest... It's true that I didn't find any food in the crates, but I did find a lot of gold and shards. It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found."<br><br>You say goodbye to him and leave.
e_sewers11_a_rp2=You can have this egg.
e_sewers11_a_rp2_s=You give him the egg and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Thank you so much!

It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found."<br><br>You say goodbye to him and leave.
e_sewers11_a_rp5=You can have my cheese
e_sewers11_a_rp5_s=You give him your cheese and tell him that you have cleared the way out of frozen dead. Surprised, he says:<br><br>"Wow, how generous! Not only are you giving me food, but it's also cheese! You see, I haven't been entirely honest... It's true that I didn't find any food in the crates, but I did find a lot of gold and shards. It's all yours, along with the mysterious key I found.<br><br>Besides, as a thank you for the cheese, you can also have my fishing rod.

e_sewers4_a_dsc=In the center of the sewers you find a throne and next to it a frozen ratman holding a goblet. Unlike the others, this ratman still seems to be alive and with a little magic you manage to unfreeze him. When he recovers he says to you:<br><br>"Where is the king, what happened? mmm... It seems that you have saved me, thank you very much.<br><br>I serve the king with a variety of goblets, some of which are even magical!

e_sewers4_a_rp5=So the king was with you on the throne when you froze?
e_sewers4_a_rp5_s=(Ratman) "Yeah, I was serving him when the frost caught us. Hmm... I remember you, you were the first of us to study magic...<br><br>You should know that a few years after your exile, the king became greedy and less fearful of the elves. He opened the vault and with his closest advisers began collecting magical items and studying dark magic. Perhaps one of these items saved him from the cold.<br><br>As a fellow ratman, I'll give you 15% off my goblets."
e_sewers4_a_rp6=Know your place, you filthy rat! Just give them to me!
e_sewers4_a_rp6_s=Yogger's threats have an effect, and the ratman leaves the goblets on the ground and runs away.

e_sewers5_a_dsc=In the sewers, you find a large vault door in one wall. Surprisingly, the door is open and leads underground.<br><br>When you go down, the cold becomes unbearable. You take a quick look and see a large tunnel, along which you can see a lot of gold and shards. It seems that more objects were kept here, but now the vault is practically empty.<br><br>You go back up quickly so as not to freeze.

e_sewers8_a_nm=The king's dark deal
e_sewers8_a_dsc=You find yourselves in front of the king of the ratmen. With a gesture, he invites you to approach and says:<br><br>"I didn't expect to have visitors who didn't come from the well...

Maybe we could make a deal.<br><br>In exchange for the jewelry and some vitality of one of you, I'll use my corruption magic to upgrade their weapon. I'll also turn a blind eye and let you all through.

e_sewers8_a_rp0=You attack him right away, while he waits for a response.

e_sewers8_a_rp2=No way am I making a deal with you! It's time to take revenge for everything you've done
e_sewers8_a_rp2_s=(King) "Mmm... I remember you... your name was Zek, right?

e_sewers8_a_rp3=I accept the deal. Take my jewelry and some of my vitality (-12 max HP)
e_sewers8_a_rp3_s=You hand your jewelry to the king of the ratmen and extend both arms, holding the weapon in one of them. The king grins wickedly and casts his spell.<br><br>Although you feel a little weaker because of the spell, your weapon glows a purple color and seems much more powerful.<br><br>Shortly after, the king points to the exit and leaves. You take advantage of his departure to search the surroundings, finding some gold and shards.
e_sewers8_a_rp4=I accept the deal. Take my jewelry, but I know you don't need my vitality for anything
e_sewers8_a_rp4_s=You hand your jewelry to the king of the ratmen and extend only one arm, holding the weapon in it. The king is somewhat angry that you know his wiles. But as he does not feel like fighting he proceeds with the deal and casts his spell.<br><br>Instantly, your weapon glows purple and seems much more powerful.<br><br>Shortly after, the king points to the exit and leaves. You take advantage of his departure to search the surroundings, finding some gold and shards.
e_sewers8_b_nm=The sewers are clean
e_sewers8_b_dsc=After a hard fight, you defeated the king of the ratmen and destroyed the scepter he used to control the dead.<br><br>You have cleared the sewers of the frozen dead, and the few remaining living ratmen have been able to escape.
e_sewers8_b_dsca=Now all that remains is to loot the king's corpse and find a way out quickly before you freeze to death.
e_sewers8_b_rp0=You search for valuable items on the king's body and in the surrounding area.
e_sewers8_b_rp0_s=The king was obsessed with jewelry, and you found several magic rings. One of them is the reason why he was not affected by the frost.<br><br>You also found some gold and magic shards in the surroundings.
e_sewers9_a_nm=Out of the well
e_sewers9_a_dsc=You find some stairs leading to the surface. They seem to belong to a well in the elven city.<br><br>The air entering the well is even colder than the air inside the sewers.<br><br>Before climbing outside, you take the opportunity to take a short break.
e_sewers9_a_dsca=rptd_e_aquar28_c_dsca
e_sewers9_a_rp0=You rest a little before climbing the stairs.
e_sewers9_a_rp0_s=After regaining some strength, you climb the stairs of the well and appear in the middle of the frozen elven city.
e_wolf1_nm=The new captain
e_wolf1_dsc=The werewolves who decided to fight for the kingdom gathered at the watchtower near the forest.<br><br>There, a commander of the human army decided to form a special advance platoon, composed entirely of werewolves. Since we knew the terrain, it would be easier for us to advance through the forest.<br><br>After forming the platoon, he told us that he needed a captain, someone trustworthy and capable of leading us.
e_wolf1_dsca=(Commander) "Anyone volunteer to be captain?"
e_wolf1_rp0=It will be an honor to serve the kingdom and lead these comrades!
e_wolf1_rp0_s=(Commander) "You're Magnus, right? You've been serving with us for a while and I've heard good things about you, the position is yours."<br><br>(Yogger) "Is he going to be the Captain? He seems kind of weak... Well, we'll see, for now I'll follow him."
e_wolf1_rp1=These rascals need someone tough like me, I'll do it!
e_wolf1_rp1_s=(Commander) "I like your enthusiasm, but I don't think that calling your comrades rascals is the type of captain we are looking for...<br><br>You, over there! You're Magnus, right? You've been serving with us for a while, you'll be the captain."<br><br>(Magnus) "Thank you very much for your trust, I will do my best to deserve it."
e_wolf10_nm=The forest strikes back
e_wolf10_dsc=We cross the forest cutting the trees to make way for the main army.<br><br>When suddenly, two small treants appear and prevent us from advancing.<br><br>The treants are clearly angry and show a special hostility towards the sentinel who helped us cut the forest.
e_wolf10_dsca=rptd_e_aquar20_a_dsca
e_wolf10_rp0=There are few treants left... We should try to avoid them
e_wolf10_rp0_s=You try to avoid the treants, but the sentinel is very slow, and it is not possible to advance without leaving the sentinel behind.<br><br>(Magnus) "It's a shame, and I'd hate to cut them down, but I promised the Queen I'd return the sentinel to her when we're done with the mission. And so it shall be!".
e_wolf10_rp1=Let's not waste any more time! Let's use the cutting machine
e_wolf10_rp1_s=(Magnus) "We should avoid them... They're a species on the verge of extinction..."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, look at them! There's no way we can go forward without a fight. Go get 'em, boys!"
e_wolf12_nm=The thieves' camp
e_wolf12_dsc=Following the forest in an easterly direction, we arrive at a small camp.<br><br>There we find the group of thieves who have stolen the gem from Lord Hanshek. One of them, the youngest, sees us and approaches us saying:<br><br>(Thief) "Wolves... I don't know what you want from us, but this is our camp and we are not willing to abandon it.
e_wolf12_dsca=Say what you have come for and leave."
e_wolf12_rp0=We know you just stole a gem. We're here to get it back
e_wolf12_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Obviously, he's the one with the gem. Captain, why waste time, let's go get him!"<br><br>(Thief) "I didn't think they'd send someone so soon... especially with the war going on.<br><br>It seems that this gem is very important to that grumpy wizard... I'm not going to give it back!"
e_wolf12_rp1=Do not make me laugh! I'll take what I want from your dead body
e_wolf12_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Yogger, control yourself... Our mission is to recover the stolen gem and deliver it to Lord Hanshek. As soldiers of the kingdom, we must avoid killing them and bring them to justice."<br><br>(Thief) "I didn't think they'd send someone so soon... especially with the war going on.<br><br>It seems that this gem is very important to that grumpy wizard... I'm not going to give it back!"
e_wolf12b_nm=The stolen gem
e_wolf12b_dsc=During the combat, we wound several of the thieves and the rest manage to flee.<br><br>The youngest of them, slightly wounded, takes the gem out of a pocket and while he gives it to us he says:<br><br>(Andrin) "I am Andrin of the Casthak family, take the gem if that is what you want. But I warn you, Lord Hanshek is not to be trusted and he is up to no good.
e_wolf12b_dsca=Do what you must with me, but please don't give him the gem back."
e_wolf12b_rp0=We will return the gem to its owner, as is our duty. As for you...
e_wolf12b_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Captain, these thieves have committed a great offense to the kingdom! We should execute them in this very place, as Lord Hanshek would want..."<br><br>(Magnus) "No need. We have what we came for and the war continues.<br><br>As for you, Andrin... I met your brother in a tavern near the city. He is a good man and I would not like to give him a hard time. You're lucky we don't have time to go back and hand you over to justice. You can go. I hope this was just an unfortunate misunderstanding..."
e_wolf12b_rp1=Hand over the gem and prepare to be executed
e_wolf12b_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Not so fast Yogger... Now we abide by the rules of the kingdom. It is true that we don't have time to bring them back to justice... But we have the gem we came for and I will personally return it to Lord Hanshek.<br><br>So, Andrin, you are free to go. I met your brother in a tavern near the city. He is a good man and I would not like to give him a hard time. I hope this was just an unfortunate misunderstanding..."<br><br>(Yogger) "You're too soft, Captain! Lord Hanshek would want these thieves executed... When the time comes I'll make sure to report to him what you've done."
e_wolf13_nm=Ottis' revelation
e_wolf13_dsc=We reach the depths of the forest and there we see a humanoid doe blocking our path. As we approach, she tells us:<br><br>(Balina) "More werewolves... I am, Balina, protector of this forest and I won't let you pass. But this is strange... What does a pigman do next to these savages? Besides, you look like a healer... What are you doing on the front line of combat?"<br><br>(Ottis) "Oink... well... I don't know. I just wanted to help... Oink, it's true. This war and the front is not for me... I should meditate on this.
e_wolf13_dsca=Sorry guys, she's right and I can't face her... Oink... I can't go on like this, I have to go and reflect."
e_wolf13_rp0=Don't worry, my friend, you've done enough. Leave the rest to us
e_wolf13_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Really, Captain? Are you going to let him go just like that? He is a deserter and must be punished! When this war is over, I will personally take care of him.<br><br>(Balina) "You have made a wise decision, pigman.<br><br>As for the rest of you, I won't let you pass through this forest without a fight."
e_wolf13_rp1=Deserter! I won't forget this. When I'm done with this doe, I'll come for you!
e_wolf13_rp1_s=(Magnus) "Calm down Yogger... That's not the behavior of someone who wants to join the kingdom... You and I will have a talk later.<br><br>Please, Balina, let us pass. We are kingdom soldiers and we just want to get to Gorio's camp as soon as possible."<br><br>(Balina) "How do you want me to believe you after what that savage said... I'm sorry, but I'm not going to allow anyone to cross this forest and I'll fight to keep it that way."
e_wolf13b_nm=The protector falls
e_wolf13b_dsc=After defeating the dryads and wounding Balina, we explain to her that we really are soldiers of the kingdom.<br><br>Moreover, we manage to convince her that our only intention is to reach Gorio's camp. Then, she tells us:<br><br>(Balina) "Sorry for the misunderstanding, the werewolves we know are not to be trusted... My purpose is to protect this forest and clean it of werewolves.
e_wolf13b_dsca=I have someone very important who is waiting for me... If you let me go, I promise I will send you reinforcements from the forest to overthrow Gorio."
e_wolf13b_rp0=You can go. We never wanted to fight you. Also, I hope you keep your promise
e_wolf13b_rp0_s=(Yogger) "This is inadmissible, Captain! First you let the piggy desert... and now you intend to let this one go too? I'm sure she won't keep her promise... This time, I won't allow it!"<br><br>Yogger shouts his threat, distracting Magnus, and attacks. Yogger takes the opportunity to deliver the coup de grace with his axe to the already wounded Balina, who dies on the spot.<br><br>(Magnus) "What have you done! She had given up and offered us help! This is not the way we should behave... This was a big mistake. You disobeyed an order, and when the war is over we will have to report what happened."
e_wolf13b_rp1=It was your fault the piggy deserted! Don't expect us to take pity on you!
e_wolf13b_rp1_s=(Yogger) "I don't like you... Besides, you seem to really hate werewolves. The Captain is a softy and I'm sure he'll forgive you, like he did with the piggy. I'd better take care of you before that happens!"<br><br>Yogger shouts his threat, distracting Magnus, and attacks. Yogger takes the opportunity to deliver the coup de grace with his axe to the already wounded Balina, who dies on the spot.<br><br>(Magnus) "What have you done! She had given up and offered us help! This is not the way we should behave... This was a big mistake. You disobeyed an order, and when the war is over we will have to report what happened."
e_wolf14_nm=Two points of view
e_wolf14_dsc=The war continues, and we finally arrive near Gorio's camp.<br><br>The platoon has had disagreements about how we have acted in the various events that have brought us to this point in the war.<br><br>The tension is palpable and now is the perfect time to rest for a while before the fight with chieftain Gorio.
e_wolf14_dsca=As we rest, we wonder what everyone's opinion of Gorio is.
e_wolf14_rp0=Gorio is too stubborn, joining the kingdom is the best option for werewolves
e_wolf14_rp0_s=(Magnus) "Queen Amelia's proposal to unify all the races of the kingdom and be able to live in harmony is the best for everyone.<br><br>Even if I have to fight my own kind, I will do my best to make this unique opportunity come true."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, you've grown accustomed to life with humans and it's softened you up. You've been domesticated... Believe me, when this war is over, they won't thank you enough..."
e_wolf14_rp1=It's clear to me that werewolves are superior to others, in that sense Gorio is right.
e_wolf14_rp1_s=(Yogger) "We werewolves should be free and not have to ask permission to hunt in our forests. Humans want to turn us into their tame dogs... Well, they won't tame me!<br><br>But I think Gorio has made a big mistake in declaring open war on humans. The end of the war is near and it will not end until Gorio is overthrown."<br><br>(Magnus) "You seem to be clear that Gorio is our enemy and taking him down is the only option to end this war. Although sometimes I wonder if you didn't join the wrong side or what your real motives are..."
e_wolf15_nm=The Chieftain Gorio
e_wolf15_dsc=We make our way through the camp until we reach a large tent. There we are greeted by Gorio, who welcomes us saying:<br><br>(Gorio) "I've heard of you... The werewolf platoon that kills their own kind on the battlefield. Humans will tell you that you're brave... but in reality you are a disgrace to werewolves.<br><br>And you Yogger... seeing you on the side of the humans especially pains me. I had high hopes for you.
e_wolf15_dsca=Now I must execute you to set an example."
e_wolf15_rp0=You can still surrender peacefully! I am sure Queen Amelia will be merciful
e_wolf15_rp0_s=(Gorio) "You are the clear example of what I don't want to happen to my werewolves. More than a wolf, you are a domesticated dog! Surrendered at the feet of humans.<br><br>I'll be sure to nail your head to a pike to set an example for the others!"<br><br>(Magnus) "I'm sorry, but you're stuck in the past, Gorio. The only way to move forward and for there to be a future for werewolves is to coexist with the others. And for that reason, today, here and now, I'm going to put you down."
e_wolf15_rp1=You have led the werewolves well and I respect you for that. But now you must die
e_wolf15_rp1_s=(Gorio) "You say you respect me? Ha! don't make me laugh... So what is the fierce Yogger doing on the side of the humans if you agree with me?<br><br>Or is it that perhaps you were looking for a chance to take my place and were afraid to face me in a duel?"<br><br>(Yogger) "Me? Afraid of you? Don't be ridiculous... You've made a big mistake by provoking humans. Someone like you should have seen coming that we couldn't win in open warfare. I would have done better! What's more, when I'm done with you, maybe I will..."
e_wolf15b_nm=The Betrayal!
e_wolf15b_dsc=After a tough battle, we defeated the chieftain Gorio.<br><br>Magnus began to speak in celebration of victory and was about to ask the rest of the werewolves to surrender.<br><br>I, Yogger, couldn't allow him to continue talking and I threw a claw at his face to shut him up. Magnus was left wounded on the ground... I had to finish him off, but just at that moment the human army began to arrive.
e_wolf15b_dsca=This was my moment. If I made sure to finish Magnus off, I wouldn't be able to escape... So before running away, I shouted to the remaining werewolves.
e_wolf15b_rp0=Those of you who want to remain free, follow me!
e_wolf15b_rp0_s=Fleeing quickly was a good decision. In a moment, the human army occupied Gorio's camp, and as we fled I could see Magnus being tended to.<br><br>Most of Gorio's men followed me, and we headed into the depths of the northeast forest.
e_wolf16_nm=The End of the War
e_wolf16_dsc=With the werewolf chieftain defeated and his followers fleeing in disarray, the war ended shortly thereafter.<br><br>The humans decided to call this conflict the Wolf Wars. As Queen Amelia had promised, the humans gave shelter to all werewolves who wanted to join the kingdom.<br><br>Rumors reached Yogger that Magnus had been rewarded with nothing more than a medal of appreciation... Soon after, Magnus decided to leave the human army.
e_wolf16_dsca=Yogger's diary ends with recounting the following months on the run and little else.
e_wolf16_rp0=You stop reading and close the diary.
e_wolf16_rp0_s=You leave the diary where you found it and prepare to continue on your way.
e_wolf4_nm=The Queen's Steel Soldiers
e_wolf4_dsc=We arrive at the human outpost. Leading the army is Queen Amelia herself, along with a small group of extraordinary war machines.<br><br>Sentinels they call them, and just the sight of them made us all shudder. It is said that the Queen has built them based on dwarven models and that she now controls them thanks to her great magical power.<br><br>As we were about to leave, the Queen tells us:
e_wolf4_dsca=(Amelia) "Take one of these with you. They are a force to be reckoned with and will cut through anything."
e_wolf4_rp0=Your Majesty... Do we really need to cut down the forest?
e_wolf4_rp0_s=(Amelia) "I see you have a good heart, but we are at war... This is the fastest way for the army to advance and reach the enemy camp quickly. The forest will heal and grow again, count on it."<br><br>(Yogger) "As I suspected... you're a softie, Captain. The end justifies the means, now and always."
e_wolf4_rp1=Ohh, great... We can't say no to such a powerful killing machine!
e_wolf4_rp1_s=(Amelia) "Don't get too carried away. Although they are indeed extraordinary, it is my power that makes them work. When the war is over I will make sure to dismantle them all."<br><br>(Magnus) "My queen, I will take care to bring the sentinel back to you when we finish our task."
e_wolf5_nm=The Sleeping Treant
e_wolf5_dsc=We reach the interior of the forest, and in front of us stands the ancient obelisk of Senenthia.<br><br>As we approach, on one side of the obelisk, we see a group of dryads that seem to be protecting a large and old treant.<br><br>Fortunately, the treant is fast asleep and the dryads do not seem to have any intention of attacking us unless we approach it.
e_wolf5_dsca=Our men await orders on how to proceed.
e_wolf5_rp0=We must not disturb the forest dwellers, we will take a detour
e_wolf5_rp0_s=(Yogger) "Captain, but why? Don't be a coward, the big one is asleep, we can finish them off easily! Come on guys, let's get them!"<br><br>(Magnus) "No! Stop! That's an order! The kingdom does not seek unnecessary conflict and it is our duty as soldiers of the kingdom to keep it that way. We'll make a little detour."
e_wolf5_rp1=Chop-chop! Time to cut some wood, guys!
e_wolf5_rp1_s=(Magnus) "No! As new soldiers of the kingdom, our duty is to avoid conflict. We'll make a small detour, that's an order!"<br><br>(Yogger) "When you were assigned as captain, I already thought you were a coward... We will make a detour, but I guarantee you that in the future you will regret not having cut down that treant now that we had the chance."
e_wolf6_nm=The Field Hospital
e_wolf6_dsc=We arrive at a camp where several healers treat the wounded from the war.<br><br>One of them, a young pigman, approaches us and says:<br><br>(Ottis) "Oink... my name is Ottis and I have come to help heal the war wounded. I have already finished healing most of them... Oink... and I think I could be more useful at the front, healing on the spot.
e_wolf6_dsca=Oink... what do you say, may I join you?"
e_wolf6_rp0=Of course you can. I am Magnus, the captain of this platoon
e_wolf6_rp0_s=(Ottis) "Oink... Thank you very much Magnus. You seem like a nice guy. I'm sure I'll be useful to you, oink... I've trained a lot in protection and healing magic."<br><br>(Yogger) "Good thinking Captain, it's nice to have something for lunch nearby in a pinch."
e_wolf6_rp1=I think it's fine... We can always use him for lunch...
e_wolf6_rp1_s=(Ottis) "What!... Oink... I don't think I heard it right... You are soldiers of the kingdom right? Oink... I may have made a serious mistake..."<br><br>(Magnus) "Don't worry, he's joking... I am Magnus, the captain of this platoon. Rest assured, with me in command you will always be safe."
e_wolf8_nm=The Mysterious Excavation
e_wolf8_dsc=We arrive at an archaeological excavation behind the ancient Obelisk. It seems that something has happened. Everyone in the place is nervous. A wizard in ostentatious robes comes up to us and says:<br><br>(Hanshek) "You are just in time! We have just been robbed of something very important. The stolen object is an ancient gem... After months of digging... When I finally got it...<br><br>The thieves were human and headed east of the forest. It is vital that you recover it for me.
e_wolf8_dsca=I, Lord Hanshek, command you to retrieve the gem at any cost."
e_wolf8_rp0=Excuse me sir, but our orders are to reach Gorio's camp...
e_wolf8_rp0_s=(Hanshek) "I assume you are the captain of this platoon. I see you don't know who I am... Well, at least you have manners. I am Lord Hanshek, court magician and advisor to the king.<br><br>Therefore, as your superior, I order you to go immediately to retrieve the stolen gem. This order takes precedence over any other, and it is of vital importance that when you recover it you deliver it only to me and no one else."<br><br>(Yogger) "Captain, you should have asked for a reward... He's too interested in us returning it only to him. It seems a bit shady..."
e_wolf8_rp1=Of course, but with a good reward we would be more motivated...
e_wolf8_rp1_s=(Hanshek) "How insolent... Unlike Queen Amelia, I would expect nothing less from werewolves... I am Lord Hanshek, court magician and advisor to the king.<br><br>If you don't want to be executed for treason, you'd better hurry up and retrieve the stolen gem. Also, be sure to deliver it only to me and no one else."<br><br>(Magnus) "Yes, sir! I regret my comrade's comment. On my honor we will see to it that the gem is recovered immediately."
//////
e_sen46_a_dsc=As you leave the bandit camp Yogger hears a faint howl in the distance.<br><br>Yogger tells you to wait here for a moment.<br><br>After a while, a wolf cub appears from the nearby forest.
e_aquar43_a_nm=Binks the resource hunter
e_aquar43_a_dsc=You meet a werewolf resting near a ladder, when you get closer he says:<br><br>"Hello travelers, my name is Binks. My friend Charls and I founded a werewolf village far from here after serving in the Wolf Wars.<br><br>Now the village is well established and I travel in search of resources or items that can be used to improve our village.
e_aquar43_a_dsca=I'm willing to buy anything that might be useful to me that you don't need."
e_aquar43_a_rp0=You don't want to sell him anything.
e_aquar43_a_rp0_s=You say goodbye to him and continue on your way.
e_aquar43_a_rp1=Long time no see! How have you been?
e_aquar43_a_rp1_s=(Binks) "Hello Captain... What are you doing around here? Are you still playing the kingdom's lapdog, after how we were rewarded after the war?<br><br>With the meager reward they gave us, Charls and I decided to leave the kingdom and found our own village. If you want to stop by, you're welcome, Charls will be happy to see you.<br><br>Take these magical shards I found around here. Looks like we both have stuff to do, see ya."
e_aquar43_a_rp2=Hey buddy! Do you remember that I lent you money?
e_aquar43_a_rp2_s=(Binks) "Hi Yogger... yes, I do remember... Our newly founded village hit a rough patch... and we needed money for repairs.<br><br>Keep this gold, it's all I have with me. When I finish what I'm doing, I'll go to the village to get the rest..."<br><br>(Yogger) "You better not forget..."
e_aquar43_a_rp3=You offer him the old rope for 800g.

e_aquar43_b_rp2=Your friend owes me money... I hope he hasn't forgotten
e_aquar43_b_rp2_s=(Charls) "Yogger... I thought you'd be dead by now... I already told Binks not to do business with you...<br><br>Right now I don't have any money... but you can keep these magic shards. When I get back to the village I'll tell Binks to pay you the rest."<br><br>(Yogger) "I'll settle for now... but he better not forget."

e_voidhigh6_a_rp7=You remember the colors of the three scarabs you saw on one wall.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp7_s=You press the yellow, blue and green colors corresponding to the colors of the scarabs on the wall.<br><br>Suddenly, from the center of the magic circle appear those three scarabs, running all over the place and leaving behind them a trail of gold, shards and supplies. After a while they disappear, and somehow the sight of them running frantically makes you feel faster than before.<br><br>You pick up everything and leave the place.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp17=Basthet prepared me for this! She told me that one day I would triumph against the darkness!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp17_s=(Hanshek) "Basthet. Who could that be? You mean the so-called goddess of Ulminin?<br><br>And who do you think you are to confront me? A simple desert cat does not understand the greatness of what I have just achieved.<br><br>Thanks to the power of this gem, not even the gods will be able to oppose me!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp18=Thanks to the curse, I am here today. To fight and stop you!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp18_s=(Navalea) "Perhaps this was Basthet's intention all along... that I would be able to fight the Archons once again."<br><br>(Hanshek) "I don't know what you are talking about, but I see that you are one of them, an architect! <br><br>How is it possible that there are any of you still alive? Mmm... Wait a moment, it seems you are of no use to me. Your body and blood are not pure, they are corrupted... What a waste.<br><br>And you expect to stop me? Even if you are corrupted, I will dissect you to learn even more from your kind."
e_voidhigh14_a_nm=The Void bells
e_voidhigh14_a_dsc=You arrive at the ruins of an ancient battlefield, no doubt this is the place Laia told you about.<br><br>As you approach the center of the battlefield, you see the restless souls of the architects who fought in the war against the Archons as they escort you expectantly towards the center.
e_voidhigh14_a_dsca=To complete Basthet's trial, you must ring the silver bell given to you by Laia three times in the center of the battlefield.
e_voidhigh14_a_rp0=You ring the bell three times.
e_voidhigh14_a_rp0_s=When the third bell rings, the souls of the architects gathered around you bow before you in thanks and disappear.<br><br>You are proud to have helped these souls in sorrow and thus completed Basthet's trial.<br><br>Laia is now free to leave her post and travel out of the desert.
e_voidhigh15_a_nm=Cathedral of Light
e_voidhigh15_a_dsc=You arrive at the ruins of an ancient cathedral, after inspecting it for a while, this seems to be the sacred place where Navalea grew up.<br><br>Although the cathedral is practically destroyed, you see a halo of celestial light descending on a small altar that is still standing.
e_voidhigh15_a_dsca=The altar bathed in holy light seems the perfect place to purify the cursed badge of Navalea.
e_voidhigh15_a_rp0=You place the cursed badge on the altar.
e_voidhigh15_a_rp0_s=Shortly after placing the badge on the altar, you notice how the cursed energy it gives off dissipates. You decide to leave the badge on the altar as it seems to be its rightful place. <br><br>You feel good that you have honored your promise to Navalea. <br><br>Thanks to what you have done, now Navalea will regain her strength and will be able to leave her tomb.
e_pyr10_a_nm=The looted arsenal
e_pyr10_a_dsc=Thanks to the information given to you by the felines, you have found the secret arsenal inside the pyramid.<br><br>However, it is obvious that it has been thoroughly looted and that the felines have been taking their technological weapons out of here for centuries.
e_pyr10_a_dsca=Fortunately, it seems that they still have left some weapons for future generations.
e_pyr10_a_rp0=You search the armory to see if there is a weapon you can use.
e_pyr10_a_rp0_s=In addition to weapons, you also find some gold that you take with you.
e_pyr2_a_nm=Basthet's statue
e_pyr2_a_dsc=After walking down the long entrance hallway, you find yourselves in a large room where there is a statue of Basthet.<br><br>Around the statue you see a pile of gold. It seems that the felines make prayers to the statue and offer gold with them.<br><br>You notice that this room is well kept, but it seems that the felines do not go further into the corridors leading to the top of the pyramid.
e_pyr2_a_dsca=Do you want to make a prayer?
e_pyr2_a_rp0=You perform a normal prayer.
e_pyr2_a_rp0_s=The statue reacts with a small glow.<br><br>You can use the statue as an altar and upgrade your cards.
e_pyr2_a_rp1=You make a prayer offering 400g.
e_pyr2_a_rp1_s=The statue reacts to your prayer and glows.<br><br>You can use the statue as an altar and upgrade your cards at a discount.
e_pyr2_a_rp2=You try to steal some gold from the statue.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_s=You offer a fake prayer and manage to pick up some gold without anything happening.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_sc=You offer a fake prayer and manage to collect some gold without anything happening.<br><br>Curiously, the prayer works and besides picking up the gold, you can upgrade your cards.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_f=When you perform the prayer and are about to pick up the gold, you notice that something bad is about to happen.<br><br>Fortunately, you stop the prayer and decide not to pick up the gold in time.
e_pyr2_a_rp2_fc=As you perform the prayer and are about to pick up the gold, you notice that something bad is about to happen.<br><br>Unfortunately, you don't react in time, and a holy lightning bolt falls from the sky and hits you. You leave before more lightning strikes.
e_pyr2_a_rp3=Mother, I have come to see you... I need your help.
e_pyr2_a_rp3_s=You see Laia perform a prayer to the statue and suddenly a voice echoes throughout the room.<br><br>(Basthet) "Welcome back, my child, I knew you would come. As you must remember, the rules must be followed and only you are free to ascend the pyramid."<br><br>Laia frowns slightly, but after analyzing her mother's words, there is nothing to indicate that she has forbidden you to go ahead anyway.<br><br>Besides, the statue glows brightly and you can upgrade one card for free for each hero.
e_pyr2_a_rp4=I know you can hear me! I curse you for what you did to me!
e_pyr2_a_rp4_s=Navalea casts a curse on Basthet's statue.<br><br>Although she gets no response from Basthet, the statue becomes corrupted and you can use it to corrupt cards.
e_pyr3_a_nm=The ancient machine
e_pyr3_a_dsc=In the corner of the large corridor, you come across some kind of ancient machine.<br><br>After examining it for a while, it seems that the machine is intended to train the user's memory and coordination.<br><br>Although you are not quite sure... you deduce that playing the machine must give some kind of reward.
e_pyr3_a_dsca=Do you want to play a game?
e_pyr3_a_rp0=You don't want to try your luck...
e_pyr3_a_rp0_s=The machine also seems dangerous, so you prefer not to try your luck and leave.
e_pyr3_a_rp1=You are up for a game!
e_pyr3_a_rp1_s=Without thinking too much, you pull a lever and get ready to play the old machine.
e_pyr3_a_rp2=I have played this before. I'm going to lower the difficulty since I'm out of practice.
e_pyr3_a_rp2_s=Laia touches a few buttons before starting the game. It seems obvious that she grew up playing this machine.<br><br>Then she pulls a lever and the game starts.
e_pyr3_a_rp3=I've played this before. I'm going to up the difficulty to get better rewards!
e_pyr3_a_rp3_s=rptd_e_pyr3_a_rp2_s
e_pyr3_a_rp4=Interesting... so in the end she did build it.
e_pyr3_a_rp4_s=(Navalea) "A long time ago... I proposed to Basthet that building a machine like this would be a good idea to train future generations of paladins from a very young age.<br><br>It seems that after all, even after exiling me... she listened to me."<br><br>Navalea inspects the machine and pulls a lever. The game begins.
e_pyr3_6_nm=The ancient mural
e_pyr3_6_dsc=In the corner of the large corridor, you find a very ancient mural.<br><br>The mural is full of very old glyphs and most of them are unrecognizable to you. Even so, your general impression is that the mural depicts the origins of the pyramid.<br><br>Upon closer inspection, you realize that several of the glyphs can be moved and rotated. You have the feeling that some of them are misplaced.
e_pyr3_6_dsca=Do you want to try to reposition the glyphs?
e_pyr3_6_rp0=You think it's better not to move anything and you leave.
e_pyr3_6_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_pyr3_6_rp1=You try to reposition the glyphs to reread the mural.
e_pyr3_6_rp1_s=As you move the glyphs indiscriminately, you hear a voice echoing down the hall.<br><br>(Basthet) "Ignorance is not allowed here!"<br><br>Suddenly a holy bolt falls from the ceiling and hits you. You decide it's best to stop touching the glyphs and walk away hurt.
e_pyr3_6_rp2=You had a vision of this mural when you fainted in the desert!
e_pyr3_6_rp2_s=You move the glyphs to place them as you saw them in your vision.<br><br>Although you still do not understand the meaning of the mural, it seems obvious to you that they are now in the correct position.<br><br>As you place the last glyph correctly, a holy light descends from the ceiling and envelops you.
e_pyr3_6_rp3=I never understood this mural... but I know that it's better not to touch it.
e_pyr3_6_rp3_s=Laia tells you that when she was little, Basthet warned her not to touch the mural. Even so, when she grew a bit older and believed that Basthet would not see her... she made several attempts to move the glyphs to solve the mural.<br><br>All of them resulted in a punishment from Basthet and a warning that ignorance was not to her liking.<br><br>After hearing this, you decide that it is better not to touch the mural and you leave.
e_pyr3_6_rp4=Indeed, the glyphs are misplaced. This mural controls various systems of the pyramid.
e_pyr3_6_rp4_s=(Navalea) "One day, this pyramid appeared out of nowhere on the sands of Ulminin. A small expedition of architects, of which I was a part, were in charge of coming to investigate it.<br><br>After several months of trying to enter without success, Basthet chose me and let me in. Over time, she gave me to understand that she was not from this world and that the pyramid was what she used to move between worlds.<br><br>She never told me anything more about why she came and stayed. Maybe with more time... if she hadn't cursed me and locked me up... maybe she would have told me more."<br><br>After telling you the story, Navalea places the glyphs in their correct position, and a holy light descends from the ceiling and envelops her.
e_pyr7_a_nm=Basthet's Enigma
e_pyr7_a_dsc=I am Basthet, keeper of knowledge and observer of the past and all possible futures.<br><br>I was expecting you and I know why you have come, but before I offer you my help, you must answer my question correctly. Fail and you must endure my ordeal to regain my forgiveness.
e_pyr7_a_dsca=In the forest of Senenthia there is a gnome, an apprentice craftsman, who is still waiting for the return of his master.<br><br>What is the name of that gnome?
e_pyr7_a_rp0=Wilbur
e_pyr7_a_rp0_s=(Basthet) "You have answered incorrectly.<br><br>You must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp1=Timothy

e_pyr7_a_rp4_s=(Basthet) "Your sincerity honors you, but ignorance is not something to be proud of, much less something to be rewarded.<br><br>You have not answered me, therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp5=Mother, we are in a hurry. We need your help!
e_pyr7_a_rp5_s=(Basthet) "My child, it seems that in a short time you have forgotten my teachings...<br><br>Rules come first! And you have failed to answer my question, no matter who you are or the rush you are in, there are no excuses or exceptions.<br><br>Therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so that we can talk again."
e_pyr7_a_rp6=You'll pay for what you did to me! I've hated you for so long...
e_pyr7_a_rp6_s=(Basthet) "My child, I can understand your hatred and your frustration... But thanks to what I did, you are here today, in this time.<br><br>Even if you don't understand it now... you are a key piece to save us all. Maybe it wasn't fair, but it was necessary to have the chance to save everyone's future.<br><br>Still, you have not answered the question, and as my first paladin you should know that the rules are unbreakable. Therefore, you must endure my ordeal and earn my forgiveness so we can talk again."

e_ulmin18_a_dsc=You find a pedestal with a strange orb on top that is anchored to the pedestal.

e_ulmin19_a_dsca=The story continues in the next tablet but it is broken and you would have to rebuild it to continue.

e_ulmin19_a_rp1_s=You manage to rebuild the tablet and continue reading.<br><br>A few years after punishing the paladin, the herons wondered if it was the right thing to do. In their point of view, she had done the right thing by fighting against the Archons... So the herons questioned Basthet and asked for mercy for the paladin. <br><br>Basthet did not answer them. Eventually the herons lost her favor and abandoned the oasis in the south of the desert.<br><br>After reading the history, you are impressed by the courage shown by the herons in questioning their benefactor.

e_ulmin19_a_rp1_fc=You do not manage to rebuild the tablet in such a way that the text remains readable. On top of that, you unintentionally break several pieces of the old tablet...<br><br>Seeing the mess, you leave the place demoralized.
e_ulmin20_a_nm=The Stone Door
e_ulmin20_a_dsc=As you make your way through the gorge, you come upon a spectacular stone door carved into the wall.<br><br>Upon entering, a large hidden blade swings down from the ceiling and almost reaches you.<br><br>You look down the long, dark corridor leading to the inner chambers and at the end of it you seem to see a small tile protruding from the wall. It looks to you like it might be a switch to stop the blade trap.
e_ulmin20_a_dsca=Entering seems too dangerous and the switch is quite far away.
e_ulmin20_a_rp0=You don't want to take the risk and you leave.

e_ulmin20_a_rp2=You try to run to the other side quickly avoiding the blades.
e_ulmin20_a_rp2_s=You run as fast as you can and reach the other side unharmed.
e_ulmin20_a_rp2_f=You run as fast as you can, but unfortunately one of the hidden blades hits you causing an open wound, <br><br>You use your remaining strength and reach the other side.
e_ulmin20_a_rp3=I will shoot an arrow to activate the switch!
e_ulmin20_a_rp3_s=Your aim is excellent and you hit the target on the first try. As you thought that tile was a switch and the blade trap stops.<br><br>With the trap stopped, you all pass to the other side.
e_ulmin20_a_rp3_f=You miss on your first attempt and get a little closer to try again.  One of the hidden blades hits you, causing an open wound, but now that you are closer you try again and hit the target.<br><br>As you thought, that tile was a switch and the blade trap stops.<br><br>With the trap stopped, you all pass to the other side.

e_ulmin21_a_nm=The abandoned camp
e_ulmin21_a_dsc=You arrive at a camp on the edge of the gorge.<br><br>From here, you can see the spectacular stone door carved into the wall of the gorge. In order to go there, you would need a rope to descend the gorge.<br><br>It seems that this camp belonged to the felines and they abandoned it some time ago to go to the more fertile lands of the southern oasis.
e_ulmin21_a_dsca=This may be a good time to regain your strength.

e_ulmin21_a_rp3=You are fine. You take the opportunity to search the surroundings.
e_ulmin21_a_rp3_s=You find some gold and some notes from the felines that read:<br><br>"After sending several expeditions to meet the djinn, we have observed that when he grants you a wish it is better not to respond. <br><br>One expedition obtained a positive result by suggesting to him that he was not powerful enough to corrupt our jewelry.

e_ulmin27_a_dsc=You see a group of herons taking sand from inside a pyramid. When you get closer, one of them tells you:<br><br>"Welcome and let me tell you something about us. Many generations ago, our ancestors made a big mistake in these pyramids. After several decades, they regretted it, but it was too late... To do penance, it is now our duty to protect and keep taking care of these pyramids.<br><br>By the way, a few days ago, the ancient Obelisk was activated and shook the desert. The entrance to the catacombs is blocked by sand and we are currently removing it.
e_ulmin27_a_dsca=Is there anything we can do for you?"
e_ulmin27_a_rp0=Can we rest here for a while before leaving?
e_ulmin27_a_rp0_s=The herons give you their approval, and you rest for a while to regain your strength.<br><br>Shortly after, you thank them and leave.
e_ulmin27_a_rp1=Surely you have something from the pyramids that you can sell us...
e_ulmin27_a_rp1_s=You manage to convince him, and the heron agrees to sell you items from the pyramid.

e_ulmin27_a_rp1_fc=Not only did we not get him to sell you anything, but you also managed to offend him.<br><br>They kick you out and you leave disappointed.
e_ulmin27_a_rp2=We are the ones who filled the eastern oasis with healing water.
e_ulmin27_a_rp2_s=It seems that the news of what you did came before you.<br><br>He thanks you again and offers you the chance to buy various items taken from inside the pyramids with a small discount.

e_ulmin27_a_rp4_s=The herons can't believe their eyes when they see Navalea. Stunned and surprised, the herons gather around her and prostrate themselves before her.<br><br>Navalea repeats that she forgives them, that they have done enough penance since it was not their fault. Their ancestors only followed Basthet's orders and could have done little else.<br><br>While you rest, one of the herons tells Navalea that they have left a hidden trail in the sand that comes out of the top of the Obelisk.

e_ulmin30_a_dsc=You see a feline standing guard in front of a pyramid. When you approach she says:<br><br>"Hello adventurers, I am Laia, the paladin of the omniscient Basthet. She foretold that you would come and prophesied that one day I would join a group of adventurers like you. But first, that group had to prove itself and pass a trial.<br><br>Right now I cannot accompany you on the trial.  For my duty is to guard the entrance to the tomb of the previous paladins.

e_ulmin30_a_dsca=Do you want to try to pass Basthet's trial?".
e_ulmin30_a_rp0=We accept the trial, and we will prove that we are worthy-
e_ulmin30_a_rp0_s=(Laia) "I had a feeling you would accept. You see, Basthet told me to give you this little silver bell. The trial is for you to ring the bell three times on one of the ancient battlefields where the war against the Archons was fought. In doing so you will purify the souls of the dead, and Basthet will be pleased.<br><br>I don't know exactly where you have to go, but if Basthet entrusts you with this test it is because she knows you will find the place. I hope you complete the trial and that Basthet will give me permission to travel beyond this desert with you."
e_ulmin30_a_rp1=We accept the trial, besides we are honorable and want to enter the tomb.

e_ulmin30_b_nm=The unguarded tomb
e_ulmin30_b_dsc=You arrive at a pyramid and the entrance to the catacombs is open.

e_ulmin31_a_dsc=You are in front of the great pyramid of Ulminin. No one knows when or how it was built, but looking at its massive and complex structure one might think it is from another world.<br><br>The entrance to the interior of the pyramid is clear and there seem to be no guards nearby.<br><br>When you try to enter you run into a faint force field that pulls you back, but not enough to stop you from getting through if you wish.
e_ulmin31_a_dsca=To enter the pyramid you will have to withstand the force field and pass through it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0=You try to withstand the force field and break through it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0_s=The force field is weaker than expected and does not affect you at all.
e_ulmin31_a_rp0_f=You manage to get through the force field but somehow you feel weird and kind of sanctified.
e_ulmin31_a_rp1=Don't worry, I know how to deactivate it.
e_ulmin31_a_rp1_s=Laia puts her hand on a tile near the door and the force field is deactivated.<br><br>You enter the pyramid.
e_ulmin31_a_rp2=These cheap tricks won't stop me!
e_ulmin31_a_rp2_s=Navalea hits the force field with her hate-filled fists and it shatters.<br><br>You enter the pyramid.
e_ulmin35_a_nm=The obelisk top
e_ulmin35_a_dsc=You reach the Ulminin Obelisk, but because of the sand you are too high.<br><br>Although you can see the Glyph, the runes that would allow you to advance are still many meters below you.<br><br>You try to make your way through the sand, but after removing a thin layer of sand, it solidifies. You get the impression that there is a chamber under the sand.
e_ulmin35_a_dsca=There is nothing else you can do here, now you have to find a way to access the lower chambers to read the runes on the obelisk.
e_ulmin35_a_rp0=You decide that it is better not to waste any more time
e_ulmin35_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_ulmin35_a_rp1=You try to look for magic shards around.

e_ulmin35_a_rp2=Follow the hidden trail left by the herons.
e_ulmin35_a_rp2_s=You find the heron trail and follow it for a while as you move away from the obelisk.<br><br>Little by little, you notice how the sand is more unstable... there is no turning back now.
e_ulmin36_a_nm=The quicksand
e_ulmin36_a_dsc=Little by little, the quicksand pushes you down.<br><br>Maybe the herons tricked you? Maybe they betrayed Navalea again, after all?<br><br>There is no time for such questions, as you are about to be engulfed by the sand.
e_ulmin36_a_dsca=All you can do now is take a deep breath and trust...
e_ulmin36_a_rp0=You take a deep breath and close your eyes.
e_ulmin36_a_rp0_s=You are engulfed by the sand, but quickly fall to a lower floor.<br><br>You open your eyes and see that the herons did not deceive you after all. You find yourselves in an ancient chamber of the lower catacombs.
e_ulmin37_a_nm=The Djinn
e_ulmin37_a_dsc=In the desert, you come across a mysterious dusty lamp. The lamp seems to have something written on it, but you can't see it because of the accumulated dust.<br><br>When you rub the lamp, a smiling Djinn suddenly appears out of it. He greets you saying:<br><br>"Thank you very much travelers! It's been a long time since I've seen anyone or breathed fresh air, hahaha... I guess, as is the old custom, I should grant you three wishes. Since there are four of you, I'll grant you one wish that works for all of you."
e_ulmin37_a_dsca=What wish would you like to make?
e_ulmin37_a_rp0=The felines recommended that it is better not to answer him.
e_ulmin37_a_rp0_s=You politely tell him that you don't want anything and leave.<br><br>The Djinn seems disappointed and as you walk away you see him go back into the lamp.
e_ulmin37_a_rp1=You had a vision of the Djinn laughing at you, so you ask for nothing.
e_ulmin37_a_rp1_s=rptd_e_ulmin37_a_rp0_s

e_ulmin37_a_rp3_s=The djinn stops laughing and says to you:<br><br>"So you are the ambitious smart-ass type... You should know that I am under no obligation to grant you a wish. In fact, I hate those who think they are smarter than anyone else... You should suffer my wrath!".<br><br>The Djiin gives you a terrifying look that leaves you frightened. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp4=We wish for mountains of gold, we want to be rich!
e_ulmin37_a_rp4_s=The Djiin keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Hahaha... a classic! Greedy people like you should learn a lesson".<br><br>The Djiin casts a spell and with it steals some gold from you. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp5=We wish for power... absolute power!
e_ulmin37_a_rp5_s=The Djiin keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Hahaha... a classic! Why should I share my power with wimps like you? Your body is not ready, I'll prove it to you".<br><br>The Djinn casts a spell and you feel the power coursing through your body, but suddenly something goes wrong, and you feel a couple of bones break. The Djin laughs and stops casting the spell. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin37_a_rp6=We wish for your freedom!
e_ulmin37_a_rp6_s=The Djinn keeps laughing and says:<br><br>"Ohh... Amazing! So you're the type to go around playing hero. But what makes you think I'm not free? A bit presumptuous of you, isn't it?"<br><br>The Djinn says no more and goes back into the lamp.<br><br>You leave the place rather disappointed.
e_ulmin37_a_rp7=Are you really that powerful? I bet you're not capable of corrupting my jewelry.
e_ulmin37_a_rp7_s=The Djinn frowns and says:<br><br>"Looks like the felines are going around telling my secrets... It's time for me to move somewhere else. But first, you will see that I am indeed powerful and I will corrupt your jewelry."<br><br>The Djinn casts a spell and corrupts your jewelry. Then he gets into the lamp and the lamp disappears.
e_ulmin38_a_nm=The Sandworm
e_ulmin38_a_dsc=When you realize you are inside a huge sand pit that slowly engulfs you towards the center.<br><br>Suddenly, a large sandworm appears from inside the pit. The worm opens its big toothy mouth and waits for the sand to drag you towards it.
e_ulmin38_a_dsca=It seems inevitable that you will have to defeat it if you don't want to be devoured.
e_ulmin38_a_rp0=You prepare for combat.
e_ulmin38_a_rp0_s=As the sand slowly drags you towards the center, you get ready for combat, you catch your breath and regain some strength.<br><br>You reach the center and the fight begins.
e_ulmin38_a_rp1=The felines warned you about the sandworm and you prepared yourself accordingly.
e_ulmin38_a_rp1_s=Fortunately, thanks to the felines' information, you learned of the existence of the sandworm. You rested for a while and prepared for combat before entering the sand pit.
e_ulmin38_b_nm=Falling down the sand pit
e_ulmin38_b_dsc=After a fierce fight you kill the sandworm and just at that moment the sand pit starts to collapse.<br><br>It seems that the sandworm was acting as a stopper and now all the sand, and you with it, falls underground.
e_ulmin38_b_dsca=You can only close your eyes and hope to fall somewhere safe without being buried by the sand.
e_ulmin38_b_rp0=You open your eyes and see what happened.
e_ulmin38_b_rp0_s=You are in the lower catacombs and have narrowly escaped death. A few meters from where you landed, there is a bottomless pit where the sand worm fell in along with all the sand above.<br><br>You quickly inspect the chamber where you are and pick up some gold and supplies that you find. Fearful of all the sand falling from the ceiling, you decide to leave quickly.

e_ulmin43_a_nm=The forgotten one
e_ulmin43_a_dsc=In a burial chamber you find a woman on the floor, leaning against an open sarcophagus. She seems very weak, when you come to help her she whispers:<br><br>"How many centuries has it been... A few days ago, I noticed the energy of an Obelisk activating; that woke me up and broke the seal of the sarcophagus.<br><br>Sorry strangers, I'm still very weak... I feel that the curse that falls on me is still active. Although it has somehow kept me alive all this time, the curse drains my strength.
e_ulmin43_a_dsca=Maybe you could help me to get rid of the curse?"
e_ulmin43_a_rp0=What can we do to help you?
e_ulmin43_a_rp0_s=(Navalea) "Thank you very much strangers, I am Navalea by the way. It's a long story, but I was cursed and locked in this sarcophagus unjustly a long time ago.<br><br>In order to lift the curse, you must first find its source. It is probably an ancient object that belonged to me long ago... now that I remember, before I was locked up, my family badge was taken away from me. I feel it must be nearby, east of here.<br><br>Once you have the source of the curse, you must purify it. In the old days there was a sacred cathedral in my homeland where you could do it... but I don't know if it still exists after the war and after so much time."
e_ulmin43_a_rp1=It seems complicated and we don't have time for that.
e_ulmin43_a_rp1_s=You tell her you're sorry but you can't help her, then you leave.
e_ulmin43_a_rp2=I won't help you, moreover... how the hell are you still alive?
e_ulmin43_a_rp2_s=(Laia) "I don't understand... Basthet should know about this, yet she didn't warn me?<br><br>I guess she doesn't care about you anymore... or are you alive because of her? I don't know... what is clear to me is that I won't help someone who betrayed her. <br><br>You're lucky we're in a hurry or I'd put you back in that sarcophagus myself."
e_ulmin43_b_nm=The burial chamber
e_ulmin43_b_dsc=You find a burial chamber with an open sarcophagus, when you go to inspect it, Navalea says:<br><br>"This is where I was unjustly imprisoned for centuries....<br><br>When I woke up, I didn't have time to worry about those things, but now that I look at it, the chamber is well maintained.
e_ulmin43_b_dsca=Besides, whoever kept the chamber seems to have left some gold and magic shards in my honor."
e_ulmin43_b_rp0=You pick up the gold and magic shards.
e_ulmin43_b_rp0_s=You pick up all the gold and magic shards you can find and leave the chamber.
e_ulmin44_a_nm=The embedded Scarabs
e_ulmin44_a_dsc=You come to a large dark chamber and on one of its walls you see something glowing.<br><br>As you get closer you see that what glows are three small decorative scarabs embedded in the wall. The three scarabs are different and one is made of gold, the other of sapphire and the third of jade. They look very valuable... <br><br>You try to pry one off the wall, but it is well embedded. If you really want one of them, you'll have to break the wall a bit to get it out.
e_ulmin44_a_dsca=Which scarab do you want to get?
e_ulmin44_a_rp0=You prefer to leave and not break any wall.
e_ulmin44_a_rp0_s=rptd_e_aquar18_a_rp0_s
e_ulmin44_a_rp1=You try to break the wall to get the gold scarab.
e_ulmin44_a_rp1_s=As you start to break through part of the wall you hear a continuous and creepy noise. Suddenly you realize that many black scarabs start to come out from everywhere and in a moment they surround you.<br><br>You have to abandon the idea of grabbing the decorative scarab and get out of there quickly. Fighting your way through the swarm of black scarabs.

e_ulmin45_a_nm=The builder's name
e_ulmin45_a_dsc=You reach a large chamber with tiles on the floor; on each tile is engraved a different letter.<br><br>You carefully step on one of the tiles and suddenly a poisoned arrow comes out of a hole in the wall and crosses the entire chamber. You dodge the arrow by sheer luck.<br><br>You notice that on the side of the room there is a small tablet that seems to refer to the builder of this chamber, but her name does not appear.
e_ulmin45_a_dsca=You suspect that to pass unharmed you have to step on the tiles that correspond to the builder's name.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0=You try to get to the other side while dodging the poisoned arrows.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0_s=You manage to get to the other side dodging all the poisoned arrows.
e_ulmin45_a_rp0_f=You manage to get to the other side but unfortunately you have been hit by one of the arrows and have been poisoned.
e_ulmin45_a_rp1=The felines mentioned that the name of the builder was Galatea.
e_ulmin45_a_rp1_s=The felines were right, and you cross the chamber without problems stepping on the tiles with the letters that form Galatea's name.
e_ulmin45_a_rp2=Her name was Galatea and she was a friend of mine.
e_ulmin45_a_rp2_s=Navalea tells you that she came to the Ulminin desert a long time ago with a group of architects and that Galatea was one of them.<br><br>Stepping on the right tiles you manage to pass to the other side without problems.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3=Let me guess the correct tiles based on their wear.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3_s=You go first and manage to step on the right tiles, reaching the other side without any problems.<br><br>The rest of the group follows in your footsteps.
e_ulmin45_a_rp3_f=You go first and manage to step on the right tiles, unfortunately when you get almost to the end you make a mistake and an arrow hits you, poisoning you.<br><br>The rest of the group follows your steps and learns from your mistake, reaching the other side safely.

e_ulmin50_a_dsc=In a chamber, you come across an ancient mural that reads:<br><br>"A long time ago, a group of architects came to Ulminin to inspect the great pyramid that one day appeared out of nowhere. The pyramid remained closed for a while, until it opened for one of them. That is how the chosen one met Basthet.<br><br>Eventually the architects built monuments in the desert, along with the Obelisk. Meanwhile, the chosen one swore an oath of loyalty to Basthet, becoming her first paladin.<br><br>A short time later, a great war began in the architects' homeland.

e_ulmin50_a_rp0=You see Navalea's badge embedded in the mural, radiating cursed energy.
e_ulmin50_a_rp0_s=You notice that on one side of the mural is embedded the family badge of Navalea. It radiates cursed energy and clearly this is the source of the curse.<br><br>You pick up the badge, and as she told you, now you will have to find a way to purify it. According to the mural and what she told you, the best way would be to look somewhere in her homeland.
e_ulmin50_a_rp1=You try to search for gold and shards in this chamber.

e_ulmin52_a_rp0=You take the white chest.

From what Laia has told you, the sarcophagi belong to the previous paladins of Basthet.<br><br>You try to open one of the sarcophagi but they are hermetically sealed and they seem to have some magic that seals them even more.

e_ulmin56_a_nm=Hall of the dead
e_ulmin56_a_dsc=You reach a hall full of undead and at the end of which you see the obelisk of Ulminin.<br><br>You notice that in the middle of the hall there is an ancient sarcophagus and around it there is a kind of lich that seems to have been resurrected with the corrupted energy from the activation of the obelisk.<br><br>No doubt the lich is the reason why all the chambers are infested with undead and there is no way to reach the obelisk without defeating it.
e_ulmin56_a_dsca=How do you want to approach combat?
e_ulmin56_a_rp0=Without wasting any time, you charge at it.
e_ulmin56_a_rp0_s=You take the lich by surprise and the fight begins.

e_ulmin56_a_rp1_fc=You fail to hide and the lich sees you. <br><br>The lich makes a terrifying scream that leaves you frightened and the lich prepares for combat.
e_ulmin56_a_rp2=I knew him... he shouldn't have ended up like that!
e_ulmin56_a_rp2_s=Navalea gets angry and hits the ground several times with her gloves, returning the darkness that looms over you to the undead.<br><br>She then charges bursting with power at the lich and the combat begins.
e_ulmin56_a_rp3=I will pray to Basthet for our victory.
e_ulmin56_a_rp3_s=It seems that Basthet answers Laia's prayer, and a glowing light purges the darkness that looms over you.<br><br>With Bastet's blessing, the combat begins.

e_ulmin8_a_rp4=You pay 300g and ask for information about the eastern desert.
e_ulmin8_a_rp4_s=(Feline) "There are several things you should know if you go east.

Also in the desert dwells a djinn who likes to tease travelers and play bad pranks. The best thing to do is to refuse his offer and leave.<br><br>Ahhh, I forgot... we also have a small store over there, we'll tell them you're going and you'll get a small discount."<br><br>You thank him and leave.

e_sen4_b1_rp3=We are in a hurry, but I will send several soldiers to help you.
e_sen4_b1_rp3_s=Amelia promises the farmers that she will send a delegation of soldiers from the castle to help them rebuild their homes.<br><br>The farmers thank the queen for her help and give you some magic shards they found while tilling the fields and an old rope.

e_sen17_b_rp4=Time has not been kind to you, old friend. I will help you.
e_sen17_b_rp4_s=(Cornelius) "Ohh... you're Amelia right? I remember I asked you for another favor some time ago... but now I don't know what it was.<br><br>The truth is that right now what I need most is my old staff. You'll find it Velkarath in my old place, I'm sure you remember where it was. Take these shards, and thank you very much Amelia."<br><br>(Amelia) "I will bring you your staff as soon as possible, my friend. And as for the other favor... don't worry, everything is fine now".
e_sen20_b_rp4=I built this golem... I didn't think I'd ever see one of these again.
e_sen20_b_rp4_s=(Amelia) "Even when I ordered it to be dismantled, we could use its help. Unfortunately right now my powers are too unstable to make it work... maybe if we find something similar to its original source we could reactivate it.<br><br>The black forge is sealed... but perhaps in its surroundings we can obtain a core that we can use to activate it."<br><br>As you hide the golem, so that it does not suffer any more damage, you find a few magic shards.
e_sen27_a_rp5=I have allowed your misdeeds for a long time... this ends today!
e_sen27_a_rp5_s=(Yogger) "The queen herself deigns to come for me, what an honor! Still, what are you doing wasting your time here... shouldn't you be somewhere else?<br><br>I heard that your own advisor has betrayed you and kidnapped your daughter. The truth is that I'm not at all surprised by that scoundrel... Well, enough of the chatter, if I finish you off today, the kingdom will easily fall into my hands!"<br><br>Although Yogger played tough with the queen... the truth is that he is quite afraid of having to face her.

e_voidhigh13_a_rp19=Where is my daughter! How could you Hanshek... You will pay for this!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp19_s=(Hanshek) "Dear Amelia, the princess is well, and thanks to her I have been able to realize my dream!<br><br>After finding this ancient jewel in the Wolf Wars, I spent years researching and experimenting with it. Unfortunately, by the time I discovered that the key to the jewel's power was the magical blood of a descendant of the architects, you had already gone into exile... Partly because of me, since it was my experiments with the jewel that destabilized your powers...<br><br>I thought all was lost... but as the princess's 16th birthday approached, she showed signs of possessing the same ancient magic as you. So I waited for the right moment and now thanks to her blood and this jewel, my power is unlimited!"
e_aquar24_a_rp2=Leave it to me! I think I can figure them out.
e_aquar24_a_rp2_s=As queen, Amelia's duty is to learn the languages and customs of the nearby kingdoms. Thanks to this, she has managed to decipher the mural.<br><br>She reads it, and from the large rune a lightning bolt comes out that hits her, but does not hurt her.

e_aquar24_a_rp2_f=Amelia was not able to decipher the mural correctly.<br><br>She reads it, and from the large rune comes a lightning bolt that hits her, leaving her electrocuted.

e_aquar9_a_rp4_s=You cut some wood from the nearby trees and give it to Nenukil, with it and the remains of the broken boat, in a moment he builds a new boat.<br><br>Now you can go through the waters of the marsh.

e_forge3_a_rp5=Give me a moment, I know how to craft all these artifacts
e_forge3_a_rp5_s=Nenukil picks up the obsidian and starts working at the forge almost without looking at the plans.<br><br>After a while he has built all the artifacts, using up the obisdian.
e_forge5_a_rp4=This is a dwarven trap box. But I know how to open it!
e_forge5_a_rp4_s=Nenukil opens the box without complications Inside the box, he finds a small mysterious key with a black ribbon.<br><br>When he passes near the statues, they are activated. Nenukil was overconfident and at no time thought that those ash-covered golems could still be active...<br><br>You defend yourselves as best you can.
e_forge8_a_rp11=Ohh! I never thought I would meet a fellow dwarf in the forge.
e_forge8_a_rp11_s=The other dwarf is surprised to see Nenukil and they both burst out laughing.<br><br>After a while of sitting near the lava telling old stories, the dwarf shares one of his carps with Nenukil. While they talk, you find a few magic shards in the surrounding area.<br><br>It is time to leave and you say goodbye to the dwarf.
e_forge6_a_rp5=After all these years... how this thing still hasn't melted down
e_forge6_a_rp5_s=Amelia tells you how many years ago she faced this machine piloted by the general of the dwarves... Unfortunately something went wrong and they had to flee.<br><br>She hoped that after sealing the Black Forge and with the recent volcano activity, it along with the other dwarven machines would have melted.<br><br>Amelia casts a spell to protect you from the heat and you face the machine.
e_forge6_a_rp6=It seems my creation has come back to haunt me... once again
e_forge6_a_rp6_s=Nenukil tells you that he was the one who designed and built this machine for the general of the dwarves, a long time ago.<br><br>Luckily for you, the old machine is quite damaged and Nenukil knows all its weaknesses.

e_forge9_a_rp6_s=(Amelia) "Coming to the Black Forge was one of the first challenges I had as a court mage and advisor to the king of Senenthia.<br><br>Who knows... maybe if I hadn't come, things would be different now and the forge would still be running."<br><br>The heat is unbearable, so you leave without wasting any more time.
e_faen16_a_rp6=If necessary, I could learn it and sing with the elf...
e_faen16_a_rp6_s=The elf refuses to teach his ancient song to a dwarf like Nenukil.<br><br>Still, since he has shown interest in helping, he gives you a few magic shards as thanks and asks you to leave.

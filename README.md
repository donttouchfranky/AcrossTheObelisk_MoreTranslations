# Across The Obelisk - MoreTranslations Mod

A fork of DontTouchFranky's MoreTranslations mod, updated for Sands of Ulminin DLC and JP/RU languages.

With this mod you can easily create custom translations for the game without having to edit the game files.

## Installation

Install [BepInEx](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_AcrossTheObelisk/).

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/stiffmeds/AcrossTheObelisk_MoreTranslations/releases/latest) and put it in your BepInEx _plugins_ folder.

Download a language pack and put it in your BepInEx _plugins_ folder.

To change the language, go to the game settings (you'll see a new language dropdown) and select the desired language.

If the mod can't find the translation for the selected language, it will use the default language selected in the main language dropdown.

## How do I create a new translation?

> A complete English example of a language pack can be found in the [MoreTranslations_English](https://github.com/stiffmeds/AcrossTheObelisk_MoreTranslations/tree/main/MoreTranslations_English) folder.

1. Create a new folder that has the name of the language to be translated, e.g. `MoreTranslations_English` for English.

2. Copy all the .txt translation files inside the folder you just created.

3. Edit the file names to match the language you want to translate, e.g. `english.txt` for English default texts, `english_cards.txt` for English card texts.

4. Edit the files with the desired translations.

5. Create a `moretranslations.txt` file inside the folder and write the name of the language you want to translate, e.g. `English` for English.

6. Place the created folder inside the plugins folder.

7. Done!

> **Note:** The files must be in the same format as the original files.
>
> **Leave the tags of the game texts as they are, do not change them.**

## How can I contribute?
